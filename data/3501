That is attached. It is in the area of managing staff that there is a negative score. 56% of businesses feel employment law hampered the management of staff to a significant extent and 82% felt overall that employment law hampered their ability to deal with people issues. Just a handful (3%) felt that employment law enhanced their ability to deal with people issues, although others did state that the process was helpful, just not the rigidity and complexity of the laws.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> (stats from 2012 Employment Law Panel)</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">This is partly down to the constant change of regulations around some of the key areas of managing staff e.g. parental leave, flexible working. I highlighted the latter in the committee session. Despite questioning a number of ministers on the flexible working ‘right to request’ policy, no one has yet answered why the Government has ignored the mantra to ‘legislate as a last resort’ and is imposing administrative frameworks around a process that works in practice already. Time would be better spent promoting the benefits of flexible working (which we fully acknowledge) rather than creating a system where employers will end up being taken to tribunal not because they get a decision wrong but because they didn’t follow the correct procedure. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If government wants to retract or create a micro business exemption for a sizeable piece of legislation, this would be the one. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Apprenticeships.

For a small employer, particularly those not currently engaged in the skills system, such a wide ranging choice of frameworks acts as a disincentive. It adds additional complexity to the apprenticeship system and the lack of flexibility within a chosen framework prevents many from being able to deliver the exact training they require. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The rigidity of the system at the moment hampers valuable employer engagement in the design.

It would be fair to say that employer engagement in the design of apprenticeships is currently is low and small employer engagement is even lower. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">Employer engagement in the design of standards</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">25% of Forum members believed that tailoring apprenticeship schemes more for the employer would help restructure the skills system and make it more employer focused.
