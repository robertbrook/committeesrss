Nonexistent. It being Xmas and all..” – by this time the terminal was already full of people, the information boards did not work and no one was able to move anywhere, apart from the people who were </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">coming in through the doors and the atmosphere inside the terminal was getting increasingly claustrophobic. There were families with children, some disabled people with their carers, a lot of luggage and the whole floorspace was filled with people and thei</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">r belongings. On occasion, a solitary Gatwick personnel would shout a destination and advice people to head to the South Terminal, where people were told they could check in their baggage and proceed on to their flights. It was very hard to hear what the s</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">olitary personnel were shouting as there were a huge amount of people and one person shouting across the terminal was very acoustically challenging. By midday everyone was hungry, toilets were blocked and flooding, no information was given; so you can easi</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">ly understand how difficult it was overall to stand in a terminal, with no information about flights, no Easyjet or Gatwick Personnel in situ to update anxious people on what was actually going on – the tannoy system was not utilised for public announcemen</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">ts until much later, and no one knew what was going on; frustrating, upsetting, baffling.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Eventually my partner and I went to get some lunch – there were no sandwiches left anywhere in the terminal and we had to have whatever they had, which was a packet </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">of two mini pork pies, popcorn, crisps and some soft drinks (on this unhealthy food I felt sick) – plus, it was very difficult, as one could not go to the toilets.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Further into the afternoon we were told to move to the South Terminal and we proceeded ther</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">e with all of our luggage. We were directed into a very crowed area and waited patiently until we were checked in.  Once we had been checked in we went through security and onto airside in the South Terminal. We were waiting for a very long time and could </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">not move as we had to keep an eye on the boards to see when our flight was actually going to take off.  Eventually we were advised to move to airside North Terminal, the wait was painful and people were crowding and shouting and it was difficult to underst</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">and overall where one was supposed to go and how.. luckily we are fairly young and still have our faculties about us, otherwise it would have been extremely challenging even at this stage.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Back in North Terminal we were waiting and waiting. We dared to go</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> and have a sandwich and a cup of tea at this stage even though again it was a pained process, through the knowledge that at any time they could announce our flight and we would </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">not hear it, no announcement could be heard, we had to keep an eye on the flig</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">ht boards at all times or feel anxious if we did not.  In North Terminal we were waiting for a good while and had now been at the terminal nearly 12 hours. There was a very heated and dangerous looking situating building whereby one Gatwick or Easyjet (not</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> certain) personnel was trying to tell a frustrated huge crowd which flights were cancelled and for which we were still waiting information on.. 38 flights were cancelled to my recollection and our flight was still due to go.. we were so painfully looking </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">forward to getting to hear good news that our flight was going to go as we have not seen family in Belfast for a year. People were crying, grown people were collapsing and screaming and crying from being so much under pressure for being at Gatwick airport </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">for so long and then being told that the flights are not going and, basically YOUR Christmas, dear, is cancelled.. Atmosphere was getting aggressive and the Police was also required to be present to keep the peace with this frustrated, loud, now angry, cro</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">wd.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Finally, late, about 11.5 hours after our flight was going to take off, we were informed that our flight has been cancelled and we were directed to a staircase, to passport control, (even though we had never been anywhere but at Gatwick) and then wh</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">en we started to be very worried about our luggage, we were told that we can claim the luggage back once we get out of passport control.. not so..</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Finally we managed to get out of passport control and back onto not airside-side of Gatwick, we went to the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">luggage area.. the luggage area was in darkness, there was clearly no power. Children were saying to the parents around us how scared they are of the dark area that they were forced to walk through. We were looking for something to happen for a while but a</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">s nothing moved, there was no staff AT ALL to ask about where the luggage was, we proceeded to go home. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">I was physically shaking, because I was so exhausted, dehydrated and undernourished.  I could not stop shaking for some time.  We had to pay 54 pounds</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> to go home as all trains that would have been viable to us were not going.. so not only Gatwick airport and Easyjet failed us, but also the whole of London’s public transport failed us.. For the transport committee therefore this is not only an issue abou</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">t Gatwick Airport – this is also an issue whereby all train traffic comes to a halt with a bit of bad weather. This, in my opinion is equally unacceptable as the lack of staff and the lack of information from start to finish at Gatwick Airport. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We manage</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">d to secure the last chicken in the “long hours” Sainsbury on our own High Street for our Christmas dinner the next day, but our luggage was lost at Gatwick until the 28</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt; vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> with no information give which also gave us a huge amount of distress.. and no prese</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">nts at Christmas!
