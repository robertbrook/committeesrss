The purpose of this event was for the Committee to have a discussion about our focus for the remain</span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">der of the Parliament. We concluded that our focus would be on the “long tail of underachievement” in education and that this theme would run through all of our inquiries. The Committee also agreed that a balance should be struck in inquiries between the two sides of the Department for Education’s responsibilities: education and children’s services.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">As part of the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">awayday</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> we invited key players in the education and children’s services field to discuss the upcoming priorities, as they saw them, for the Committee. The invitees included education journalists, the president of the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, the CEO of an Academy chain, the NAO and a varied group of academics. The views of these stakeholders fed into the Committee’s brainstorming of future inquiry themes.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The Committee routinely considers the option of commissioning research as part of the process for selecting inquiries.

For example, we considered the opportunities to communicate with the media and with schools, teachers and pupils directly in its inquiry into School Sports following London 2012 (the Third Report of 2013-14). The timing of the inquiry was also considered as part of the communications plan: we published our Report to coincide with the first anniversary of the 2012 Games in order to attract media attention and to be most relevant to the public.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Evidence sessions</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">It is our standard practice to divide questions for each evidence session into blocks of specific issues to be pursued by individual members.  Often, a member may take the lead on a subject throughout an inquiry but we have not formalised this practice.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">We make every effort to take evidence from a wide range of witnesses, including front-line practitioners and those affected by Government policies.

We also carried out a survey of previous oral witnesses to gather their views on the performance of the Committee in public evidence sessions.
