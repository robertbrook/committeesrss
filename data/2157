Unfortunately they seem incapable of so doing, and therefore the process by which we currently claim rights of way is inevitably highly necessary.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The existing procedures, as set out in the Act, are cumbersome and time consuming, and for volunteers to undertake, quite daunting.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">It is therefore encouraging for us to see that the Stakeholder Working Group has made a number of recommendations to simplify the process.

However, that failed to deliver virtually any recorded ways before being withdrawn, but actually caused the volunteer network that had for the previous 50 years worked tirelessly to undertake that work,  to relax and  presume that all would be well. Unfortunately time passed, volunteers aged, and now some 50% of the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">time  allocated</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> to record these lost ways has elapsed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The provisions of the 1949 Act required a 5 yearly review of the Definitive Map, In Essex such reviews did not occur for some 30 years or more, also policies were adopted that caused great disadvantage, Equestrian access was seen as unessential, the cost of higher status rights of way was seen as disadvantageous to the Highway Authority, and wherever there was discord at Parish boundaries over status, the lower was given precedence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Equestrian access, i.e. bridleway status, has since 1968 included cyclists and the very idea that, in times past, the ancient lanes of Essex were the preserve of only </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">the  pedestrian</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">, and should be recorded only as footpaths, is absurd.
