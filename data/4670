As a union GMB has taken a firm stance on this issue, but nonetheless receive regular reports of teaching assistants being expected to carry out invasive procedures such as tube feeding or </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">injections in mainstream schools.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> This is a serious issue which puts both pupils and staff at risk, and which we hope the committee will investigate further.</span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The sixth bullet also questions the value for money of the academy programme as a whole. We believe there are many aspects of the p</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">rogramme which have led to a shameful waste of public funds. Our submission however seeks to highlight one aspect of which we have special experience. As a result of the transfer to academy status, HR policies and </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">contracts</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> being re-written by HR professio</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">nals who do not have the same experience of education and the public sector, and are now administered by a proliferation of individual HR departments instead of specialist HR services provided centrally by local authorities. These two factors have meant hu</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">ndreds of hours of negotiations with trust and academy HR departments, all funded by the public purse. Most frustratingly, the conclusion of that </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">process is</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> often to arrive back at similar conclusions to prior existing NJC terms. For example, thee legal du</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">ty on employers to provide time off for training of trade union health and safety representatives means this inevitably forms part of national agreements, but has had to be argued for repeatedly with individual trusts. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">GMB are in the process of conducting </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">research to establish an estimate of the increase in HR costs resulting from the fragmentation of the education system, and would welcome any further investigation by the Committee.</span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">There has been a loss of accountability and fairness in the employment rel</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">ationship for school support staff </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">as</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> a result of academisation.
