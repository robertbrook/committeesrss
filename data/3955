I am a member of the public. During the period 2007 to 2010, when fundraising for a NHS Trust Hospital Cancer Unit, I became the recipient of unsolicited public interest disclosures from an associate medical director working for the Trust.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The matters which caused concern to this doctor and some of his colleagues related to standards of patient safety at a neighbouring NHS Trust. This Trust commissioned an Inquiry into them after they were exposed by the media in 2009. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Following publication of the Inquiry a number of doctors were referred to the GMC by several doctors. I also made some referrals. None of the complaints resulted in Fitness to Practise Hearings. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">My perception is that there is a considerable lack of professional and public confidence in the GMC as an effective regulator of doctors. One of the main reasons is that the GMC is perceived as failing to treat whistleblowers seriously. The purpose of this written evidence is to provide an overview of the GMC's handling of my complaints in order to illustrate why many believe that the GMC still has much work to do before it becomes trusted as a regulator. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Evidence</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">1.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> The GMC initially declined to investigate my complaints on the grounds that matters had already been investigated by the locally commissioned Inquiry. I provided evidence to prove that this was not correct. For example the Inquiry did not investigate the reasons for failings of clinical governance by medical directors and other senior clinicians. I formed the opinion the GMC expended more effort finding reasons not to investigate the complaints than impartially and objectively reviewing the information provided before making a decision. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">2.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> I provided documentary evidence to the GMC that the doctor who had disclosed patient safety concerns to me stated that he and his colleagues were “scared” and “frightened” to raise concerns through proper channels. The GMC appeared disinterested. As far as I am aware it did nothing to investigate why the doctors were scared and why an associate medical director resorted to whistleblowing to me instead of insisting that his medical director took the concerns seriously. I have seen no evidence that the GMC is leading the way to promote a culture where doctors are empowered to raise concerns about patient safety without fear of retribution from their medical directors. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">3.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Many of the responsible officers who perform revalidation of hospital doctors are medical directors, yet I have observed that when they suppress whistleblowers and put patients at risk of unsafe care, they do so with impunity, free of proper scrutiny and regulation by the GMC. I believe doctors at this level are untouchable. The GMC seems too intimidated by them and their lawyers to regulate them. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">4.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> My experience of the GMC's complaints process is that it lacks openness and transparency.

However it was not made clear to me whether they were Stream 1 (full GMC investigation) or Stream 2 (enquiries made with the doctors' employer). Some aspects of my complaints related to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">what had occurred between doctors and their medical directors. This rendered Stream 2 inappropriate. </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">My experience of the GMC is that it does not exercise sufficient diligence to establish the facts of a case.

One of them related to the conduct of a former medical director. The purpose was to determine whether the closure decision was materially flawed, taking into consideration the public interest. It acknowledged that it was regrettable that it had not investigated the complaints in more detail when they were brought to its attention and admitted that the original decision to close them was flawed. Nevertheless the GMC, in the face of vigorous lobbying by Medical Protection Society lawyers representing the doctors, decided that it would be unfair to the doctors reopen the cases. I do not believe that the public interest was properly taken into consideration in the GMC’s decision.</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">5.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> At the Committee's 2012 Accountability Hearing Professor Sir Peter Rubin said that the GMC is the most transparent regulator in the world. He said that where a doctor's practice is impaired the information is on the GMC website. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">This is not entirely correct. The GMC's website shows only information about doctors whose cases have been reviewed by an Interim Orders Panel or a Fitness to Practise Panel. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">6.</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">When a doctor's practice is impaired leading to them undertaking “remedial” action, my experience is that the GMC conceals this information from patients and the public. In the case of two doctors about whom I and others complained, one was the subject of serious allegations relating to a particular aspect of their work going back to at least 2004. Their employer finally stopped them from undertaking this work in 2010. This information only emerged in a response from Foundation Trust regulator Monitor to a Freedom of Information Request. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">7.</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Another doctor who was the subject of similar allegations going back to at least 2004 undertook “remedial” action, whatever that means.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">8. </span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Last year the Committee told the GMC that it believed the arrangements for informing patients of circumstances where a doctor has been required to undertake remediation measures are not sufficiently clear.

It has refused to make public the answer to a question raised by the Department of Health in 2010 as to whether the doctors about whom I and others </span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">made complaints have been reviewed by the National Clinical Assessment Service (NCAS) as part of remedial activity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">10.</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> The GMC regards it as an infringement of the doctors' privacy to answer the question. The identity of the doctors is already in the public domain, in the Inquiry Report commissioned by their employer. The GMC seems not to appreciate that if the doctors had been reviewed by NCAS, it would provide some reassurance to patients and the public that they were being properly regulated.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">11.</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> By concealing this information from patients and the public the GMC has left a cloud of uncertainty over the professional competence and commitment to patient safety of the doctors and the extent to which they are being properly revalidated and regulated.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">12.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> When it closes complaints the GMC resorts to the usual regulator speak </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">“I appreciate that you are likely to be disappointed........”</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Disappointment can only occur when an expectation is not met.
