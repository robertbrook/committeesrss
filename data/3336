font-size:12pt">It is important to state that we support the principles of competition, but believe that the approach has to be sensitive to the needs of the voluntary sector. Our primary concern is that the regulations as they are currently worded could have an unintended impact on voluntary sector providers of health services. We are concerned that the current ambiguity about when competition is and is not required could create uncertainty and lead commissioners to conclude that they will have to routinely use competitive tendering when contracting.   This could lead to services which are currently being delivered to a high standard and with good patient outcomes being unnecessarily put out to open competition.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt">We believe that rather than providing clarity about the operation of competition in the NHS, the draft guidance risks adding to the confusion.  On first reading of the scenarios and examples which are presented throughout the guidance, in many instances it would appear clear that a commissioner would not need to use open competition, however as one works through the examples, the advice serves to add confusion and by the end, it is simply unclear what form of procurement should be used.  We are concerned that current draft guidance will create uncertainty amongst commissioners and, faced with the risk of legal challenge, they will unnecessarily decide to use open competition.  We believe that this will lead to unnecessary disruption and potentially poorer services for patients, families and carers.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt">This would lead to unnecessary administrative and financial burdens being placed on Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), as well as providers, and could in turn lead them to bundle services into ever larger community services contracts.  There are already examples being cited in the sector press which suggest that this is starting to happen.  This poses a significant risk for many charities as our binding charitable objectives mean that we would be unable to bid for such large contracts.   This could mean a loss of expertise; specialism and added value that we bring to the NHS could be lost.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="21" type="1" style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Ultimately we believe that Commissioners should be left to decide when competition is used and that the guidance should make this clear.   Without such guidance there is a significant risk that charities could be effectively excluded from delivering NHS services. This would mean a significant loss of expertise, as well as poorer services for patients, given the degree to which charities enhance services available to patients through the use of charitable funds, which means that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">the NHS gets more services for the money it invests and patients get enhanced services.  As a result, the NHS gets much more than is budgeted for or would be available from other providers.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="24" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Charitable organisations inevitably have a much narrower purpose than existing NHS organisations and those from the private sector.  Charities have been established to address particular inequalities or injustices and these are reflected in their governing objects, for example in relation to end of life care, cancer or diabetes. This inevitably has implications for the way in which they prioritise their work and spend charitable funds.   Broad contracts are likely to exclude many charities, even in collaboration with other charities, from bidding for them.  This is because charities generally have very specific objects which will have been agreed with the Charities Commission and which do not include “catch all” language that enable them to undertake other activities.  Entering into a contract that goes beyond those objects and sub-contracting the activities that go beyond the objects is not a legally permissible approach.  Therefore if a tender has a scope that exceeds a charity’s objects – not an issue which faces the private sector or an NHS body – then a charity is excluded from anything other than whatever specific sub-contracting role it is able to negotiate.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt">Large value contracts result in a potentially higher level of risk for an organisation which can be inappropriate for a charity to undertake.  Contracts with high risk profiles may also have the effect of excluding charities as they either will not have the reserves to cover that risk or because trustees prudently consider that this would be an inappropriate risk for an organisation entrusted with charitably donated funds to undertake.  Contracts may have high risk profiles either because of their value (an obvious factor but one which becomes more significant if commissioning is carried out at the care pathway level), their structure or their terms.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt">The experience of many charitable sector organisations of the Work Programme (Department for Work &amp; Pensions) is that the primary/secondary contractor model invariably relegates charitable organisations to the secondary contractor, which brings with it considerable risk to the organisation, with little guarantee regarding income.   Payment by Results (PBR) merely further exacerbates the imbalance between risk and return for charitable organisations and individual trustees.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt">In order for charitable sector organisations to able to compete or collaborate with other providers, it is essential that contracts are bundled so as to maximise the potential involvement of charitable sector organisations.  Where it results in the procurement of a contract for the delivery of an entire care pathway then this can result in prejudice to a charity – either because of the contract scope / objects issue raised above or because of the question of contract risk levels. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt">We are concerned that this could ultimately lead to charitable providers being forced out of the market. This would be a real loss for patients, families, and carers. In addition to providing high quality services, as previously stated many voluntary sector providers contribute charitable funds they raise towards patient care on top of the money that they receive from the NHS.   If voluntary sector providers were forced from the market, the NHS would struggle to meet the gap left by the absence of charitable funding, or alternatively patients would experience less comprehensive services. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt">Despite many national and local charities being active providers of NHS services, with a huge potential to provide more vital high quality services in the future, there is no meaningful reference to the charitable sector in the consultation document at all.  The guidance should make clear the diversity of current and potential providers and include case studies which include charitable, third sector providers and demonstrated the scope and scale of what we can deliver.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';
