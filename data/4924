The Charter of Fundamental Rights is more extensive than the European Convention on Human Rights. It controversially includes social and economic rights, whose implementation would be costly and would unduly constrain the budgetary options and policies of elected British governments. Moreover, given its numerous sections and the inclusion of very vague wording in some places and specific commitments in others, the full text of the Charter seems bound to involve problems that have not yet become clear. For this reason, the author supports the view that it would have been advisable for the UK to have withheld its support for giving the Charter legal status under the terms of the Lisbon Treaty. With the European Convention already in existence and with its key articles incorporated into UK law, there was no need for a further European bill of rights.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Nevertheless, the contents of the Charter are not the only or the main reasons for concern.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Unacceptable complexity and lack of clarity of jurisdiction over human rights in the European Union</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">4.

The Declaration confirms Article 51 of the Charter itself, emphasising that it does “not extend the field of application of Union law beyond the powers of the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union, or modify powers and tasks as defined by the Treaties”." (Miller, 2013, 3)</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Miller recalls that the then Foreign Secretary, David </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Miliband</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">, "</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">assured the ESC on 16 October 2007 that the Charter would not “extend the reach of European courts into British law”, that it “only records</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">existing rights under domestic and international law” and does not create new ones."

A second argument is that the Charter is not to be feared since it will apply only to matters that already fall under the competence of the European Union. Even if this view is accepted, a bill of rights such as the Charter is likely to be used by the Luxembourg judges to extend the reach of European Union jurisdiction well beyond the straightforward meaning of commercial provisions in the European Union treaties.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><br /><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">This is illustrated by the experience of the United States. In the USA, "interstate commerce" is a federal responsibility under the Constitution. The Interstate Commerce Clause was used in a good cause during the epic battle for civil rights as a lever to achieve the racial integration of motels and for related purposes only indirectly related to interstate commerce.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><br /><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">However, the use of a commerce clause by the top federal court to overrule state legislatures within the USA may be used also for more controversial purposes. Concerning the European Union, the adoption of the Charter encourages a broadening of the scope of decisions by the judges in Luxembourg. That court decided on grounds of gender equality under the terms of the Charter that insurance company can no longer base motor insurance premiums on commercial considerations. Irrespective of the fact </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">male</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> drivers are more accident prone than female ones, premiums cannot reflect this.

Third, British fears of the effects of the Charter were assuaged by the so-called "opt out" negotiated by the then UK Labour Government as a condition of its agreement to the Lisbon Treaty. Yet it turns out that the supposed "opt out" was no such thing but merely "a clarification of its effects in the UK."

The loss of democratic accountability inherent in systems of rights may be justified if they have been introduced by a process of full public debate and preferably by a super-majority, if they are sparing in the rights selected, and if they are subject to legislative checks and balances.

Implicit in this position is that developments concerning European Union affairs cannot be a one-way street toward a federal United States of Europe. The "ever closer" union envisaged in the treaties must be seen not as a commitment to an eventual federation but to ever closer friendship. There is a legitimate and realistic view that this is more likely to be achieved by respecting national sovereignty and by safeguarding and promoting democratic institutions in the individual member countries rather than by an attempt to create a dominant super-state based in Brussels.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">14. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Thankfully, increasing concerns have been expressed by senior politicians, judges and commentators in the UK about the expansive interpretations of international courts of vaguely worded bills of rights</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">the state by the Minister of Justice cited above in Paragraph 11.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">.

If the Supreme Court finds that a law is inconsistent with rights set out in the Human Rights Act of 1998, it may issue a "declaration of incompatibility" but it is then for elected legislators to decide whether or not to change to law in question in response to the Supreme Court. If the legislature does not wish to do so, it is the legislature that prevails. There is a similar system in Canada.

While this memorandum does not set out to resolve the highly complex legal technicalities involved in negotiating a meaningful and robust UK opt-out of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, a tentative suggestion is put forward for discussion. Where UK litigants bring forward cases to the Luxembourg court relating to matters within the competence of the EU, </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">a UK opt-out should mean that such cases should be argued without reference to </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">the Charter</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> and</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">entirely on the basis of normal EU law and.
