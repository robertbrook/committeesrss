font-size:12pt">all</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> this and have heard our previous witnesses, so can I just have your views as to the advantages, both commercial and tax, of structuring a business as a partnership rather than as a company?  Apart from the obvious limitation of liability, what additional advantages might LLPs, as distinct from general partnerships, offer their members? </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Murphy:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> I am a member of two LLPs, so I have some experience in this area.  The clear advantage for many people with regard to an LLP over a conventional partnership will be the formulised structure, which provide</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> a legal protection, in part, from your other partners, which in a general partnership I would generally rate to be the biggest risk you face, candidly, and something to be avoided at all costs, if possible.  I have never seen bigger consequences of a partnership than people falling out with each other, and that is in my previous role as a professional adviser where I have seen that happen often.  That I would put as number one.  </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is very important to say that in tax terms a partnership is not as advantageous for most people as a limited company, because we are ignoring the fact that when compared to the vast majority of partnerships—90% of partnerships are small and over half turn</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">over less than the VAT limit—the vast majority of small companies will pay little or no </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">national insurance</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.  Members will be taking out their rewards by dividends and therefore little or no PAYE and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">national insurance</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> will be paid, whereas the members of a partnership do pay </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">c</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">lass</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">2 and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">c</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">lass</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">4 </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">national insurance</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.  So, by and large, the tax liability in smaller partnerships, which are the most common, is higher in a partnership than it is in a company these days, and most people would therefore choose a company over a partnership.  Therefore, a partnership structure is chosen for other reasons.  There are significant administrative advantages to a partnership.  I certainly find those appealing.  The fact that a partner can withdraw funds during the course of the year without paying PAYE on that occasion</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> means that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">there is flexibility.  In that sense, there is flexibility with regard to repayment of capital, because the capital needs of some businesses obviously fluctuate.  There is cash flow.  Tax is paid twice a year on 31</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">January and 31</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">July.  That clearly helps some partnerships and it is seen as an advantage.  For very many people it will be a reputation issue; it looks like a professional structure as well.  Personally, I was told by my professional indemnity insurers </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I had to differentiate my own affairs from being a sole practitioner as a chartered accountant when I was undertaking the sort of work </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I do for </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Tax Research</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, and so it gave me a separate legal i</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">dentity.  </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The numbers of reasons involved are very high, therefore.  There is no simple answer, and I think Malcolm</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

that is clearly tax-motivated.  I do not think there is much doubt that in the larger firms there has been a significant tax advantage to the</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> use of the LLP structure while</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">partner firm of accountants for many years.  We were not an LLP in those days.  We had very occasionally minuted partners’ meetings, but we had a partners’ meeting every day.  We normally walked off and bought a sandwich together at lunchtime and resolved the issues of the day during the course of going to buy a sandwich and coming back again.  Now, of course we were all active.  Could we prove it under the test that is currently being requested?  I am not sure we would, in that sense, very easily pass.  </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The rules being put forward with regard to capital requirements seem to me to be based upon another era of business.  The number of businesses that require, in small partnerships, a partner to contribute a quarter of their expected annual earnings in capital is tiny.  My LLP does not require that; it clearly does not.  I am a knowledge</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">based business.  I do not need to put in a quarter of my annual income to fund the purchase of a few Apple Macs</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

or, under the settlements legislation, whether an artificial member </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">is </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">included, frankly, because they are a spouse of the main partner, which is an issue that is not discussed.  </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt"> I first came across mixed partnerships very early after LLPs were introduced.  The first one I came across was another chartered accountant, who told me he had created a mixed partnership because, he said, “It is anomalous”.  Companies can have one member, but an LLP has to have two, so he had formed a company, which he owned, to be his own partner, so </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">he could have LLP status.  That is quite common, by the way.  I think that is done frequently, and the corporate member in those cases is a mere nominee getting £1 a year or whatever—peppercorn.  I certainly think that was common in the first place, but then it became obvious to some people that they could shelter income in this way.  </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">One of the previous witnesses said you surely should not be allowed to mix and match.  You either choose to be a corporate entity and therefore </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">to </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">be able to shield your retained profits from tax, or you should choose the advantages of an LLP and accept the consequences of the structure.  What has quite clearly happened is that a number of lawyers and accountants have decided to do that mixing and matching.  I think that is inappropriate.  A number of anti</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">avoidance measures would have come to me before these ones.  For example, requiring the withholding of tax at source on payment of profits to a corporate entity would be an obvious exercise to overcome the problems that Richard is addressing in some of the points he is making.  That would have helped no end and increased tax yield.  The other one would be to say, “No, you cannot have a corporate entity as a member and most certainly you cannot have a corporate entity not tax-resident in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> as a member”, but that is the problem we have.  </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">avoidance legislation, and at least 40% could fall into that category, where the Government would </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt">out to be used quite often, simply because it is necessary because quite a large part of legislation is created for that reason.  Of course, I would argue</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt">.  Let me give you one simple example.  The Prime Minister last year was very keen to say that he was going to tackle offshore tax abuse whil</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">e</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> at the same time moving the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> companies.  The two moves were quite clearly in conflict one with the other.  How, as a consequence, can anybody undertake a review of outcome against objectives when it was not clear what </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">g</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">overnment policy was in this area?  Were they trying to encourage businesses to move profits offshore or were they trying to encourage businesses to move profits onshore?  It just was not apparent.  Legislation said one thing</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">policy statement said another.  Until they are clear about what they are trying to achieve and speak with one consistent tone, an evaluation process is always going to be a failure</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and I have seen no evidence that that evaluation process is therefore taking place in any effective way at all.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> very difficult to judge their performance on that, but it is all tied in with the consultation process.  That gap between what they are really trying to do and what they say they are trying to do would not be so wide if the whole process was opened up and people who do not agree with them necessarily, people who they find a bit uncomfortable, were allowed to come and discuss and analyse their proposals, rather than them being kept within this closed shop of officials, Ministers and big accountancy firms, lawyers and big corporations.  If you opened that up, you close that gap and then we can judge whether they are performing much better.  </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;
