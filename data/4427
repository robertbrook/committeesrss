When trying to take a look at actual f</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">igures for transport spending however these are hard to find and obtain. It is our understanding, from analysing requested information, that Newcastle sets aside (informally ring-fenced) £0.3m on an annual basis from its portion of the ITA block grant (LTP</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">3 budget) with a pre-determined split between revenue and capital. The budget remains unscrutinised, unmonitored and unchecked - public society has no say. This also means that in a city of nearly 300,000 inhabitants less than £1 is spent on cycling (</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">as</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> a </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">combination of revenue and capital).

Nonetheless, the increase in available budget comes with a challenge too.
