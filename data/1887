Kent County Council is focussed on the delivery of outcomes and would question whether it is necessary for the detailed climate science to be fully understood by everyone in order to achieve carbon savings and build resilience. It is important that we, a</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">s a local authority, understand the science to inform our work programmes and priorities but, once identified, how we communicate these will vary. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.4pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">5. What is essential is for Central Government to be very clear on their priorities, based on the climate sc</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ience, which Local Government can then apply in a locally appropriate way. For example, Kent County Council has been involved in the development of the National Adaptation Programme (informed by the national CCRA) and is addressing the recommendations thro</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ugh the Kent Environment Strategy. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.4pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">6. Kent County Council recognise that the impacts of climate change will not be the same across the UK and so local expertise to build the evidence base and take forward priorities identified is important, however increa</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">singly limited resources and lack of statutory drivers from Central Government can make this difficult. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.4pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">7. Kent County Council is a partner in an </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Interreg</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> IVA 2 Seas project entitled Coastal Communities 2150 (led by the Environment Agency).</span><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> This project </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">looks to engage local communities in planning for future environmental and coastal change and as such, the project looks to provide communities with the information they need to make decisions for their area, including locally relevant information on clima</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">te change. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.4pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">8. Officers attend events in three priority communities (identified through a review of vulnerability around the Kent coastline) to gather input from a range of community members. Events include carnivals, open days and fetes to try and capture</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> as much input as possible. Through this we have spoken with at least 500 people on climate change, presented at meetings and seminars to another 500 and have had 2,400 hits on our website. In addition, pop ups are placed in areas of high footfall such as </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">supermarkets and community centres. From working with the public in this way, we have had the opportunity to interact with a wide range of community members and get their insight into their areas and what climate change might mean for them. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.4pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">9. In the main we find that community members have had a greater awareness of climate change than had been anticipated and this is very much based on information provided through the mainstream media. However, we have found that although communities are aw</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">are, detailed understanding of climate change and the influences upon it are often very mixed with people taking away the messages from the media that align the most to their viewpoints. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.4pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">10. Although the vast majority of scientists have reached a consensu</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">s on climate change, there is often a disproportionate focus in the media on uncertainty and scepticism, which although crucial to meaningful debate, to a layperson gives the impression that it is a confused picture and doesn’t motivate action. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">11. From </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">our experience there are four apparent groupings around views on climate change (in descending size order):</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">a. Those who are aware of climate change, our influence on it and what the main implications are likely to be. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">b. Those who are aware of climate c</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">hange but do not see it as something we influence and we therefore cannot control it. Often stating that this is part of longer climate cycle and is inevitable. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">c. Those who do not accept that climate change is occurring or an issue. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">d. Those who are not</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> aware of climate change at all (very rare). </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">12. The different groups influence how we engage. For instance, both of the first two groups are interested in building resilience as, regardless of human influence, there is acceptance that change is occurrin</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">g and we need to plan for this. However, when it comes to mitigation it is the first group who are more likely to be interested in energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment in relation to climate change, for all other groups the messaging becomes m</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ore around saving (and generating) money. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">13. For the third group, in addition to saving money we use messages a lot more around severe weather and its implications. That is, we are not currently as well prepared as we could be and the need to plan better</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> for flooding, drought, heat waves etc. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">14. In general, we have found that the vast majority accept that climate change is an issue and one that needs to be addressed. Where there is significant confusion is who, how and when. Climate change is still very</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> much seen as a far future issue whilst people have very immediate and pressing concerns now. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">15. The fact that we are </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">currently </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">seeing changes and need to prepare for these is not getting through, although recent severe weather events around the world (d</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">espite it being unclear whether these can be wholly attributed to climate change), is increasing this awareness. Many are also seeing change in their areas, highlighting growing patterns and biodiversity in particular. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">16. It is clear from our engagement </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">is that people are not overly interested in the detailed science, they know the headlines and they want to know what they can do about it. In fact we have developed detailed information on the science for our projects, but it disengages the majority of tho</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">se we have worked with.

Governance across the county on climate change has been clearly defined with a Kent Environment Strategy Executive Officers Group and the Kent Climate Chan</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ge Network.
