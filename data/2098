Firstly, R3 has serious concerns that allowing practitioners to be partially authorised for either corporate or personal insolvency could reduce standards across the profession and may thus affect the quality of advice given to debtors.  Secondly, we are concerned that this provision may have a disproportionate impact on R3’s members who work in small firms, many of whom are micro-businesses.  Thirdly we question whether the measure will prove to be deregulatory.   </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In addition, we do not believe that Clause 9 supports the intention of the Bill - to reduce the burden of regulation on businesses. Whilst we appreciate that partial licences may be attractive to some of the large firms, R3 has serious doubts over whether the proposed partial licences will be utilised widely and as such, the proposal adds unnecessary layers of complexity to the current authorisation regime. In our view, the current regime works well and ensures Insolvency Practitioners are highly qualified. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Evidence from R3’s membership shows that just 27% and 5% of members specialise in either corporate or personal insolvency respectively. In addition, part 390B of the draft Bill, which determines that a person who is partially authorised may not act in relation to partnerships, will rule out many IPs, that undertake such work, from obtaining a partial licence.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In addition, Clause 390B of the draft Bill, which provides an exemption relating to membership of a partnership, should not apply in Scotland, with regard to the personal specialist authorisation. In England and Wales an insolvent partnership can be dealt with through “corporate” insolvency procedures, e.g.  </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">liquidation</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, whereas in Scotland an insolvent partnership is dealt with through a “personal” insolvency procedure i.e. sequestrated (bankrupted).

This licence is contingent upon passing the Joint Insolvency Exam (JIE) and gaining a significant amount of practical insolvency experience (approximately 600 hours for most licensing bodies). The JIE incorporates both personal and corporate insolvency papers and students must pass each paper to become qualified. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Clause 9 of the draft Bill introduces a new ‘partial authorisation’ level, which allows IPs to be granted licences to act either only in relation to companies, or only in relation to individuals. R3 has serious concerns about the implications of Clause 9 and feels strongly that the provision is unnecessary and will add further complexity to the current regime.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The explanatory notes of the draft Bill advise that these changes will ‘increase accessibility to the profession and improve competition.’ However, R3 believes that the proposed partial licences will not be widely taken up by practitioners for two principal reasons. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Firstly, a survey of R3’s membership demonstrates that just 5% of IPs </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">work</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> in firms that deal with personal insolvency only and 27% in firms that deal with corporate insolvency only. It is clear that an overwhelming majority of the profession practice in both corporate and personal insolvency and therefore would not be suitable for a partial licence.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Secondly, section 390B of the draft Bill prevents partial licence holders from acting in relation to partnerships. Whilst large firms may have a limited practising scope and only deal with insolvent companies, they will often act in relation to </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">partnerships, which means</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> they will not take up partial licensing exclusively as this would fetter their ability to act in the full range of cases they wish to cover.  As such, it seems reasonably likely that firms such as these will require at least some of their </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">employees to have full authorisation, despite the firm’s focus on corporate insolvency.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Given the reasons outlined above, R3 does not believe the proposed measure is deregulatory. It is likely that the partial licences will be utilised by only a small number of members of the profession and, as a result, this will not improve competition within the sector. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The current system of authorisation works well and ensures IPs are highly qualified and well equipped to deal with the complex situations they are often faced with. IPs </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">have</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> a significant level of responsibility and must make decisions which have a considerable impact on a variety of stakeholders, including suppliers, employees, as well as the wider economy. To provide proper advice to individuals and corporate entities, R3 believes it is necessary to have knowledge of insolvency legislation in its entirety. By way of example, an IP advising a company might need to provide advice on the directors’ personal debts. Insolvency is already a narrow specialism and reducing it further could impact on the quality of advice provided to individuals and companies.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="16" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">For the insolvency regime to work properly, it is necessary that creditors and the wider public have confidence in the industry. The level of knowledge and extensive experience required to become a qualified IP plays a significant role in ensuring that the profession is held in high regard. If the current standard of qualification is reduced, there could be a wider impact on the reputation of the industry as a whole.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="17" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">R3 is also concerned that Clause 9 may have a disproportionate impact on R3’s members who work in smaller firms. The explanatory notes outline that the partial licensing regime will ‘reduce the cost of training and ongoing regulation for Insolvency Practitioners who specialise’. However, given an estimated 75% of small firms undertake both corporate and personal insolvency procedures for commercial </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">reasons,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> it is likely that very few small firms will be able to take advantage of these benefits, as it would reduce the scope of work they could undertake.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="18" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Whilst we do not believe that partial licences will be taken up widely, as mentioned above, it is more likely to be the very large firms who are able to adopt partial licensing (as their business models are more likely to have a limited practising scope).  As such, there is a risk that partial licences will create an unlevel playing field across the industry, making it relatively more costly for smaller IPs to compete in an already difficult market.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">R3 is of the view that the proposed partial licences, contained within Clause 9 of the draft Bill, are not deregulatory. They are unlikely to increase competition within the sector and risk adding complexity to a licensing regime that currently works well. In addition, R3 has serious concerns that the proposed changes will have a disproportionate impact on smaller IPs and may reduce overall standards. The changes would therefore appear to make the current regime unnecessarily complex, with little tangible benefit. For the reasons outlined above, we would caution the Government against introducing these measures.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">Schedule 5, part 6 – repeal of provision for authorisation of nominees and supervisors in relation to voluntary arrangements</span></p><ol start="20" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Under the current system, individuals can be authorised to act solely as nominees or supervisors in voluntary arrangements.

In addition to the seven Recognised Professional Bodies (RPBs), the Secretary of State also has the power to authorise practitioners. In contrast to the RPBs, the Secretary of State does not have the power to establish a disciplinary regime, which would enable it to impose a range of sanctions for regulatory breaches. The only power available to the Secretary of State is to withdraw a practitioner’s authorisation, which is extremely draconian and therefore rarely used. This means that for a range of conduct breaches, which are not serious enough to warrant withdrawal of authorisation, the Secretary of State effectively has no regulatory powers. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="24" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The proposal to remove Secretary of State </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">authorisation</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, alongside recent changes to the regulatory framework for IPs, will ensure that all practitioners are regulated to the same standard and there is consistency and commonality across the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">regime.The</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Secretary of State also acts as an oversight regulator for the RPBs.
