font-size:12pt">The gradual shift in British politics towards some kind of multi-party system creates many headaches for proponents of televised leaders’ debates.  In the 1960s, when television executives and party representatives first met to discuss the introduction of a televised ‘confrontation’ between the party leaders, it was easy to identify which politicians had a strong claim to participate: the Labour and the Conservative leaders.</span><a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> In 2010, it was much less easy to identify which politicians should take part.  In the event, the broadcasters (BBC, ITV and Sky News) and representatives of the three largest national parties took it upon themselves to decide who would participate: Labour Leader and Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Conservative Leader David Cameron and Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg.  As a sop to the other parties, some were allowed to participate in one or more of the other 18 broadcast debates held before the election.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">The question of which parties should be included in any election debate must first address its purpose.  In the context of British democracy, televised leaders’ debates are usually justified as an opportunity to showcase and expose to public scrutiny the policies of the parties and the personal qualities of their leaders.  In an era of multi-partyism, there are two potential guiding principles for determining who should participate.  The first is that debates should be between prospective </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">heads of government.  The second potential guiding principle is that debates should be between leaders of all parties that stand a chance of being in government either by themselves or in coalition with other parties.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">Although the first principle is more exclusive, it is generally less problematic than the second in terms of its application.  The second principle cannot be used to justify the exclusion of parties from leaders’ debates if they only field candidates in certain parts of the country since regional parties may play a role in government formation.  It is also difficult to use the second principle to justify automatically the exclusion of parties that do not currently have MPs, especially in cases where a party lacking parliamentary representation in the House of Commons enjoys significantly higher levels of popular support than a party that has such representation.  Moreover, the application of qualifications based on the number of MPs may deny such parties a platform and reinforce allegations that the existing parliamentary parties are acting as a cartel and using their past success to restrict current debate.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">Attempts to justify who participated in the 2010 leaders’ debates fell between the two stools of the first and second principles.  Brown and Cameron took part because the former was the current prime minister and the latter was the best-placed challenger for that job.  Clegg took part, not because his party was ever likely to obtain a majority or a plurality of seats but because the Liberal Democrats could conceivably hold the balance of power in a hung parliament.  In many ways, the decision to include Clegg along with Brown and Cameron in the 2010 debates has established a complicating precedent.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">If the 2010 leaders’ debates had been solely about pitting prospective heads of government against each other, in line with the first principle, only Brown and Cameron should have taken part.  By any account, Clegg was unlikely to lead the largest party after the election.  Anyone who emphasises the ‘bounce’ in Liberal Democrat support that followed the first leaders’ debate on 15 April must recognise that this represents a post hoc justification of Clegg’s presence.  And they must also recognise that any relatively unknown leader on such a platform is likely to enjoy a surge in support.</span><a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">Before any future leaders’ debates, it would be desirable for the organisers—whether broadcasters, political parties or some other body—to specify the rationale behind the debates and to invite parties to take part according to appropriate and consistent criteria. Thus, if a debate is ostensibly meant to showcase potential heads of government, it should be exclusive.  Under present circumstances, only the leaders of the two largest parties should participate.  If a debate is meant to showcase leaders of all potential parties of government, in line with the second principle, it should be more inclusive than arrangements were in 2010. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">It should also be noted that being the leader of the junior partner in a coalition government does not, by itself, constitute a reason for participating in a leaders’ debate on the basis of the first principle, not does it confer a privileged position on the basis of the second principle.  All parties that may reasonably be thought to sustain or form part of a government ought to be represented, or none at all.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The British 2010 leaders’ debates were far from unique in terms of blurring the two principles: three-way debates have been held in Ireland, and the number of protagonists in Canadian debates has varied. However, debates in other established parliamentary democracies across Western Europe and the Commonwealth generally included only the leaders of the two main parties, despite the fact that, as in the case of the Netherlands and Germany, minor-party participation in coalition governments is the norm.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">On balance, we would favour a debate that includes only the leaders of the two main parties and is ostensibly between de facto prime-minister candidates.  The job of prime minister is sufficiently important to warrant such a debate; it would be in keeping with constitutional and parliamentary practice, which recognises only one Leader of the Opposition; and it would mean that all other parties are treated equally.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We hasten to add that our support for an explicit ‘prime-ministerial’ debate does not mean that we rule out the holding of other election debates, involving a larger number of parties, that focus on specific policy areas or regional concerns.  Indeed, such broadcast debates would greatly complement a debate between prospective heads of government.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">How many debates, and who should organise them?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="16" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The successes and weaknesses of the 2010 leaders’ debates were a product of the rules agreed by the broadcasters and political parties in the months before the election. The decision to structure part of each debate around a designated theme—domestic policy, international affairs and the economy respectively—was, on the face of it, a reasonable attempt to ensure coverage of a wide range of issues.  As our research shows, the agreed rules did, on the whole, constrain both the leaders’ statements and the broadcasters’ choice of questions.</span><a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">  A clear majority of content was devoted to the designated theme in the first and third debates, domestic affairs and the economy respectively.  However, in the second debate, just over one-third of the content was focused on international affairs.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="17" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Because the rules and the broadcasters’ choice of questions were the most important factors in shaping what the leaders said, the broadcasters had an especially important role in selecting questions that covered the issues that the public wanted to—or perhaps should—know more about.  With hindsight it is possible to question whether they got it right in all cases.  For example, only one in five questions across all three leaders’ debates in 2010 focused the economy, despite its overwhelming importance.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="18" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The broadcasters deserve much credit for organising and administering the leaders’ debates in 2010.  However, problems may rise if debates follow the same format in future elections.  One problem relates to the selection of questions and the coverage of issues.  If a series of debates is conceived of as a series, then there probably ought to be a single authority with responsibility for the series as a whole.  Moreover, the selection of questions should be co-ordinated as far as possible across all debates.  Any model that leaves an individual broadcaster with ultimate responsibility for ‘its’ debate risks making the coordination and coverage of all issues a hit-and-miss affair.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">A second problem relates to the role of the broadcasters themselves.  In 2010 the BBC, ITV and Sky News acted as a virtual cartel in organising, administering and promoting the leaders’ debates.  Indeed, the number of debates was primarily a reflection of the number of broadcasters who wanted to host them.  The fact that the debates were organised by broadcasters is important, since broadcasters are regulated by law.  If broadcasters organise future debates that privilege certain parties or are seen to be politically partial, they may well be challenged in the courts.  (The challenge may not succeed, of course, as happened in 2010 when the Court of Sessions rejected the Scottish National Party’s attempt to ban the broadcast in Scotland of the BBC’s third debate.)</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">A third problem is that broadcasters are always likely to experience a conflict between organisational and public-service motives.  If each debate in a series is produced by a single broadcaster, there is a risk that that broadcaster will be concerned as much with showcasing its organisation as about serving the public interest.  In 2010 the broadcasters generally did a good job combining good television with serious opportunities for public education, but there is no guarantee that public-service goals will always come first.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">A fourth problem, as seen in 2010, is that a </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">series</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> of high-profile leaders’ debates can dominate a campaign, suffocate other forms of electioneering and, in the process, unfairly privilege the three parties taking part.  To some extent, the primacy of the debates in 2010 was a product of their novelty, but it was also a product of their timing—taking place in each week of the campaign—and the heavy advertising that preceded them.  The broadcasters had an understandable interest in promoting </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">their</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> debate but this was at the expense of downgrading other aspects of the campaign.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">Insofar as such problems need addressing, one obvious solution would be to jettison the idea of having a series of leaders’ debates and instead organise a single and explicit ‘prime-minister candidate’ debate at some point during the course of the campaign.  A one-off debate of this kind would be less likely to skew the campaign and would greatly simplify the selection of questions and coordination of content.  There would also be no need to have themes for different leaders’ debates.  An explicitly prime-ministerial debate could be complemented by other debates, involving more parties, which focus on specific issues and give a platform to other senior politicians.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">We do not think it matters where a one-off televised prime-minister candidate debate is held.  The whole purpose of broadcasting a debate is to make it accessible nation-wide, something that would be facilitated by it being transmitted by multiple broadcasters.  What matters is recognising regional concerns in the selection of questions.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">In terms of the format of leaders’ debates and the relative balance between questions, statements and open discussion, much depends on the number of debates to be broadcast and the number of participants.  More issues can be addressed by fewer participants in a single debate, and more issues can be addressed by any number of participants across a series of debates.  We are reluctant to be prescriptive about the precise format used to structure a debate.  However, we do think that there is a strong case to be made for allowing leaders a little more time to present closing and especially opening statements—at 90 and 60 seconds respectively, the rules were a little limiting in 2010.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">Another solution to some of the problems we identify would be for election debates—perhaps all broadcast debates but especially prime-minister candidate debates—to be organised by an independent body.  There would then be no question of this body—it could be a new entity or an existing body, such as the Hansard Society—being driven by commercial or partisan interests.  It would need to work with the parties and broadcasters, but it would take the lead and be responsible for any debates that take place.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">Crucially, any debate organised by such a body would be a public event that all broadcasters would be entitled to cover; the broadcasters would not have direct responsibility for the debate itself.  Thus the debate, as an event, would not be bound by the impartiality rules that constrain the public-service broadcasters.  The broadcasters would, of course, need to be impartial in their coverage, which they could achieve, for example, by giving other parties the right of reply or by covering other debates in which other parties take part.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">If the purpose of a leaders’ debate is to provide a platform for the leaders of all parties that may play a role in government formation, then more parties should be invited to participate than in 2010.  Appropriate criteria—which would serve as a threshold to prevent an unmanageable proliferation in the number of participants—could be based on the number of seats in the outgoing Commons, the vote share in the last general election, the vote share in the most recent local elections or some other yardstick.  We note, however, that any criteria could be defended or criticised on the basis of ‘fairness’.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">It is not just the rules governing the organisation and administration of the debates that matter.  The Committee should also consider how debates are covered by broadcasters, an issue outside of our own expertise.  As others’ research has shown, for example, the use of visual continuous response measures, or ‘worms’, to track the real-time responses of undecided voters, may affect viewers’ perceptions of who won a debate.</span><a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">British democracy cannot resist the general trend towards the personalisation of politics and election campaigns.  All the broadcast election debates in 2010 reflected this trend, just as they reinforced it.  However, debates can strengthen democracy in the sense of engaging voters and providing information about the policy choices on offer, as our research confirms.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">Politicians and policy makers should ensure that future debates do not distort and skew whole election campaigns, and that all debates should be organised to serve the public interest, not the broadcasters’.  To that end we favour the creation of some independent body to oversee the organisation and conduct of future debates.  We feel that debates administered by such an entity would be more likely to prioritise the public interest over the long term than debates administered by the broadcasters and parties alone.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;
