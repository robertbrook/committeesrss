The level and proportion of funding I provided </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">to the DAATs was based on historic arrangements (i.e. the level of funding provided to them by the Home Office in 2011/12, minus the cut in the community safety grant that the Commissioner received for 2012/13 – approximately 12%). On investigation the Hom</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">e Office confirmed historic funding allocations to DAATs were based on the number of custody suites in their local authority area.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Major changes are due to come in effect to custody provision in 2014/15 in Avon and Somerset, with a reduction to four main </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">sites (of which three are completely new suites, built via PFI). Therefore DAATs will see a very different number of custody suites/cells in their local authority area – with Bristol moving from having a majority of custody places, to none. Given this I de</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">cided (in June 2013) to undertake an innovative single commission for this service to commence from April 2014.

The cost of this was split between all the DAATs and the Office of the PCC.

The scheme in Bristol has been very effective in reducing serious acquisitive crime - in the period 2007/08 to 2012/13 Serious Acquisitive Crime rates have </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">reduced in </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Bristol by 58% which is the biggest reduction over this period in any of the 8 core cities. The other core cities who have made significant investments in IoM (Nottingham and Greater Manchester) have also seen significant reductions in recorded </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Serious Acquisitive Crime. As part of implementing the Transforming Rehabilitation proposals I would want to see IoM arrangements replicated through the service delivery arrangements as far as possible e.g. private sector staff being seconded in to IoM sch</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">emes as probation staff are currently. One of the reasons the Bristol IOM scheme has been successful is that it has focused in a very targeted way on those offenders with the highest risk of reoffending. It would probably be helpful overall if a prescripti</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ve approach was taken in the specifications of the Transforming Rehabilitation service requirements as this would be a means of ensuring a consistent approach to IOM across the country based on the most successful schemes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
