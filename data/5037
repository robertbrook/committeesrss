Every year we help over a million people who have been victims of crime, and support almost 300,000 witnesses in the criminal courts. We give victims and witnesses free and confidential emotional support in the communities where they live, as well as practical help and information about the criminal justice system. We also run the Witness Service in every criminal court in England and Wales which provides support to witnesses called to give evidence in court. In addition to the help and support that we give directly to victims and witnesses we also work to raise awareness of their needs and campaign to improve their rights and treatment, both within and beyond the criminal justice system. We have </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">1,500 staff and more than 5,6</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">00 volunteers.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">PCCs and </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Commissioning of Victims’ Services</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Over the next two years the commissioning of victims’ services will transfer from the Ministry of Justice to Police and Crime Commissioners. The ‘core’ service of referral </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">of victims from police forces and the subsequent support of those victims is largely provided by Victim Support under a grant from the Ministry of Justice. This will continue until September 2014 in its present form. From October 2014 an as yet unspecified number of PCCs will begin providing locally commissioned referral and support, and will be funded directly by the Ministry of Justice to do so.

Changing the mechanisms which deliver victim services while simultaneously expecting those same services to become more comprehensive and responsive in relation to victims' needs </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">and additional right carries significant risk.  The Committee may want to examine how well this risk is being monitored and managed.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'HelveticaNeueLT Std'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Training:</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> The quality of current victim care, which results in a 94% satisfaction rating, is due to the commitment of our volunteers and staff and the quality of their support and training. Training is designed, developed and quality assured by Victim Support centrally. New providers will have to develop their own training and ensure it </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">is</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> fit for purpose – </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">something which </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">takes considerable time. In addition, new entitlements for victims and witnesses are being introduced under the Victims Code and Witness Charter increasing the need for specialist knowledge of multiple aspects of the CJS</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">. The Committee may want to satisfy itself that PCCs have effective measures in place to ensure effective, high-quality training can be provided under </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">their </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">new arrangements.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Volunteer value:</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> Much of the current highly-regarded victim care work is provided by over 5,600 volunteers, who provide more than £21 million of value through their work. We know that a significant number of our volunteers will leave if they are suddenly asked to start working for another organisation, for instance the local police, rather than a charity with which many have a long-established and deep relationship. This would clearly mean the loss of knowledge and great local expertise, which would severely damage the quality of victim care. Prolonged uncertainty about the future also impacts on paid staff who manage volunteers and ensure national standards are adhered to.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> The Committee may want to examine PCCs’ plans to minimise the loss of experienced and dedicated volunteers and staff.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Data security:</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> Information on victims’ cases must be kept on IT networks accredited to the Government’s CESG Impact Level 3 or, for domestic violence cases, Impact Level 4.  Few if any IT companies are able to provide networks to this level of security so PCCs and their local provider organisations are likely to struggle to put secure infrastructure in place in time. We know from independent research that 44% of victims consider secure data handling to be the most important attribute of a service provider. Incidents involving the mishandling of data of young victims and victims of domestic or sexual violence are likely to significantly undermine public confidence.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> The Committee may therefore wish to satisfy itself that PCCs have plans in place to maintain data security to the current high standards.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Victim Support </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">would be pleased </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> to provide any extra information on these topics which the Committee would find useful, and to give oral evidence.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Javed</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> Khan</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Chief Executive</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Victim Support</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">December 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
