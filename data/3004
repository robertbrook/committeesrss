font-size:12pt"> I thank all six of you for coming along. I apologise for the difficulties of sitting you all round the table in a way whereby you are able to confer with each other. Apologies if the order is not quite as you would have hoped it might have been. What I would like to do is to kick off this inquiry. We are very keen to look at the way in which a cross-Government sustainable development is embedded. As you are aware, we have been doing some work with the National Audit Office. For reasons, good or bad, BIS is the Department that it has been decided we shall focus on as an exemplar or otherwise of how to embed sustainable development. We will be looking across a whole range of different areas, including regional policy, manufacturing and higher education. What I want to do from the very start, before my colleagues come in, is to ask you, Emma Ward, as the Sustainability Development Champion, what your role is and how your previous experience equips you to bring all your colleagues and ministerial team into line on this agenda.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Thank you very much, and thank you for hosting us today. We are very pleased to be here. I would also like to thank the NAO for doing the review. As you will be aware from the report, I became Sustainability Development Champion in March of this year. I was asked to do so as a member of the Department’s Operations Committee, which is part of the overall governance of the Department and reports to the executive board. I have sat on that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">committee since March of last year. My day job is Director of Local Growth in the Department. That covers a whole host of policies, from local enterprise partnership and cities policy, for which we share responsibility with DCLG and the Cabinet Office, to European structural funds. Both of those policies have considerable impact, in terms of driving economic growth and development and focusing local places and local partnerships on issues like how to ensure that businesses can take advantage of low-carbon—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I just cut you short there? You mentioned growth, and I think that the conundrum for us is how that growth is sustainable growth and so how your role pursues that sustainable growth, so you look at economic, environmental and social and find the balance within that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. I think overall the NAO report reflected that. Obviously the Department is the Department for growth. We very clearly have that as both a Government and a departmental ambition. What is very clear in the way that we articulate that, is what we are looking for is sustainable growth, both in terms of the social and the environmental impact, but also in terms of the Government’s rebalancing agenda around sectors and places, so in any number of ways. Both the Department’s objective of pursuing sustainable economic growth—and it specifically does say that—and also the Government’s plan for growth, which is also very clear on that, give an articulation of that. Then it is how we do that below those headline ambitions that is obviously key.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How do you measure what success you have had in the amount of time that you have been in this role?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In the role itself?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I have been in the role for a very short time, not even a year, so six months.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I appreciate that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We have worked quite closely with NAO over the last three months to look at the Department’s systems and processes, to look across its operations, across its policies, across its procurement. That has helped me to start to shape what this role ought to look like. I have taken quite an active role, in terms of leading the Green Guardian network, which is a network of volunteers across the Department. In terms of what this role will do for the Department and sustainability, I think it is on the back of the NAO report that I take my lead and that has helped me to shape how that works. I can talk a little bit about how we have looked to strengthen our governance arrangements on the back of the NAO report a little bit later if you would like me to.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you have some formal terms of reference for your role?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do now, yes.

As I spoke to the NAO it became clear to me that it would be helpful if there were, both for the Department and for external stakeholders, and so the Operations Committee approved those at the end of July I think it was.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How does that sit with other colleagues within BIS?

That will help us to ensure, and assure ourselves, that we are embedding sustainability in the way that the Government’s ambition drives us to and the way in which the Department desires us to.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q7 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How much time do you spend on this role as opposed to the local part of your brief?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Over the last two days quite a lot.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q8 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You say “quite a lot”; is it something that you should just be doing full-time without having other responsibilities?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, I don’t think it needs that. What the Department is looking to do is to embed sustainability, as it is looking to embed other cross-cutting Government priorities in its work. That means that everybody in the Department, every policy official, every member of staff, needs to recognise this as an issue and needs to understand what guidelines are in place, what commitments the Department has that it needs to meet, and they need to take that on their own accountability. My role as Champion is to give that visibility and to ensure that there is effective leadership in the Department, the governance arrangements are in place and to report to the board on that. That does not require a full-time role and I give it as much time as it needs, depending on the circumstances.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you have input into the Department’s business plan?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q10 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> From your point of view, why are there only two listed things there that relate to that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Because the departmental business plan is a high level document. It does not seek to set out everything that the Department does. I think what it does is make very clear that there is an ambition on the part of the Department to pursue sustainable growth.

There are some who would suggest that if sustainable means we can go on doing it ad infinitum, then a growth model that is basically about the production and consumption of more and more resources is not sustainable on a planet of finite resources. When you are looking at sustainable growth, what are you actually looking at?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think you can debate that for quite a long time. At the first meeting of the Sustainability Committee, which I mentioned, we had quite a discussion on what we were going to use as our definition of sustainability. What is it that we need to communicate to staff in the Department about what this means?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q12 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline Lucas:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What did you decide?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It will change as we go but where we started was that the Department has a very clear role in terms of rebalancing the economy—so as I said, sectors and places—so looking at sustainable growth from a rebalancing perspective. It has a very clear role in terms of climate change adaptation and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Those two things are very clearly within the Department’s remit. It also has a clear role in terms of the social inclusion agenda, the skills agenda, and ensuring that those policies are also sustainable. There are a number of places where the Department’s policies very clearly have a sustainability access, and I think that is where you can take your definition of sustainable growth from.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q13 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline Lucas:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is that codified somewhere?

What the Department decided two years ago, as part of its restructuring, was to embed sustainability alongside everybody’s role. There was no decision when I was appointed Champion to create a specific unit or resource within the Department to simply pursue this agenda. We have a number of policy units that very clearly lead on this agenda, in terms of climate change and in terms of low carbon. But in terms of assuring ourselves that the Department is embedding this, that is the role of the Champion and it is the role of every individual in the Department to do that. My role as Champion is to ensure that we have the systems and processes in place to do that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q18 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Spencer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes. But some might say that the business plan appears to list only two sustainable development actions. They are the Green Investment Bank and looking at—I wouldn’t say carbon leakage—high intensive energy industries. Whose job is it then to come forward with new policies, is that your role or is that somebody else’s role?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is the role of officials across the Department. One of the challenges for us is that the business plan is a relatively short document. As I said, it does not cover everything that the Department does. One of the things that the Sustainability Committee, which I chair, will look at is how we use our internal business planning and reporting processes to tell a better story about what the Department is doing. These are two things that have been highlighted in the business plan but they are not the totality of what the Department does around sustainability. The Green Investment Bank is there, the Centres for Offshore Renewable Energy, engineering, which is part of my brief, structural funds, negotiations in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and the new structural funds programmes, which will have five of the 11 thematic objectives, will be very clearly within sustainability objectives of low carbon, social inclusion, issues like that. None of that is reflected in the departmental business plan. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is a disjoint between what is reported at a very high level and all of the other activity that is going on in the Department, so I think there is a visibility question there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q19 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Spencer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So I am clear in my own mind, is it your role then to prove those policies as they come forward or do you have any role in creating those policies?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not have a cross-cutting role. Through the Sustainability Committee, I have a mandate to ask the Department to reflect on whether the internal business planning process sufficiently challenges the rest of the Department to ensure that it is looking at these things. My role is certainly to ensure that, when we report on them, we tell the best and most comprehensive story that we can about what the Department is doing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q20 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Spencer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.

It is one of the other things that we have talked about on the Sustainability Committee—and it was picked up in the NAO report—about whether overall the Department takes a strategic enough view about the whole of its policies and whether there is more that we can do, so exactly that. One of the considerations that we will have to have on the committee is whether we need to do more of that and whether that should be part of my role or, for example, whether we should be using the Green Economy Council, or some other body like that, to help us test whether we are doing enough or whether there are some policies that are going the wrong way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q21 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline Lucas:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is a strategic question, as you just said to my colleague, but at the end of the day it is also a question about teeth.

We are on a journey of embedding this. We started two years ago. I would say that there are three things that we are doing. The bit where we are leading—and that is where a lot of the things that Emma has outlined are very clear—is very straightforward in terms of identifying that there are things that need to be done that we are doing. There are things where we are complying, which tend to fall back into my area, for example, the greening Government type of things. I think the Department has come a long way in getting to that stage. I think we are now at what they call the third stage, which is the improving bit. That is, having done the things that needed to be done immediately, are we </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">embedding this in our policy-making in the right way? The fact that the Operations Committee has this as a standing item on the agenda, and the fact that I sit with the Operations Committee, means there is a way in which feedback can be given direct into the executive as to how we are doing on this agenda. Ministers are very supportive of this as well and we are accountable to Ministers about whether we are making—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q23 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline Lucas:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Perhaps it is too soon to say, but are there ever proposals that have come forward where you can demonstrate things have not happened because they did not pass the sustainability test?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Howard Orme</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, I don’t think so and I think that is the stage we are now at. Implementing a raft of policy reforms, as we have done in every part of our business including restructuring ourselves, means that there is a sequence to this. Part of the remit we are giving to Emma, and to the group that I sit on as well, is to do exactly that and challenge whether we are doing enough, whether we have the right challenge processes. If they are working, fine, we will just leave them. If they are not then we will intervene.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q24 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline Lucas:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The business plan tells us that development and delivery of policy, including policies that support sustainability, are reported to the board. That is the phrase. In that reporting to the board, are sustainable development policies explicitly identified, and in reality how does the board know whether those policies are sustainable?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Howard Orme</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Again, we are acknowledging that we are on a journey. On the bits that are very clearly aligned to the agenda, for example, the Green Investment Bank, as anybody involved with that will know, the board is all over it to make sure it is moving along in the way in which it is intended. I think we are at the next stage where the board will take a direct interest, depending on the outcome of the review that Emma and the team are doing about how well we are doing across the board, and if we need to make some changes we will do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q25 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline Lucas:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In terms of influencing business partner organisations to include sustainable development objectives in their remit, do you have any remit to try to influence the partners of BIS on this subject?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Howard Orme</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think that is the next stage in our development as well, again, following the leading, the complying and now the improving. Yes, all partner organisations do know Government policy on sustainable growth and through our usual arrangements, which are that they are accountable for their business, they will be taking those into account. For certain partner organisations this is a major issue for them, the Green Investment Bank being an obvious one. For some it is less obvious and they need to embed it in a different way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of complying on greening Government, again you will see us making progress step by step in that area too. We are now at the stage of taking stock with our partner organisations to say, “Are there things we should now be doing more across BIS?” The approach that we are taking is one we have tried in other areas as well, which is on the transparency agenda where we are also following a similar type of path as we are doing here. A couple of years down the road we are saying, “We have done the obvious things. We have done the bits that we have been told we must do, now how do we get the join up across BIS where we can get into the improvement side?”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the excellent things about BIS is we do have some good partner organisations who are frankly better at this than the centre of the Department. We need to leverage that across the BIS family. That is part of the enthusiasm and support that we will be giving Emma and the team to realise.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q26 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline Lucas:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> To probe that a little bit more. I appreciate it is early days, but do you envisage that your ability to influence partner organisations will go beyond simply persuading? Some of those partner organisations will be dependent on BIS for their funding. Presumably that gives you rather more leverage than when we are talking about organisations that are self-funding, for example.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Howard Orme</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Steve can probably echo the other side of this. As we go down various parts of our remits some of them are very directed, for example, to comply with the greening Government agenda. That is not one where the Department itself would tolerate non-compliance. Quite rightly, other bits should be much more laid out by the partner organisation itself and it is important that we have given them the right brief to do that. For example, in things like grant letters—and Steve may well want to comment—the brief that HEFCE have to fulfil the sustainability agenda is built into the governance of the Department and organisation itself. Of course we have a range of partner organisations and we have to make sure we are giving the right brief to the right partner organisation. This is not a one-size-fits-all.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q27 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Martin </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Accepting sustainability as a work-in-progress in the Department, have you managed to identify ways of raising understanding of sustainability among members of staff and make it a central part of their jobs?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I will answer that question initially. A lot of work is done, both by the voluntary Green Guardians network but also by Janice’s Green Economy team, to raise awareness in the Department, both of the kinds of work that the Department does that contributes to this agenda but also wider interests. The Green Guardians network itself had a very full calendar last year, a number of successes both in terms of raising awareness of things like recycling, climate change, energy usage and others. As Champion, one of the first things that I did was to get that group together to try to look at what the annual programme of events was going to be within the Department, to ensure that we were regularly raising the awareness of staff about those kinds of issues so I think quite a lot already happens.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q28 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Martin </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do all members of staff have sustainable development included in their job description?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q29 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Martin </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Apart from you, does anybody have it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Apart from me quite a number of people will, yes, and it is back to Howard’s point about where we lead and where we comply. There are staff that are very clearly in the lead in developing sustainable, low-carbon, green policies. Whether it says “sustainable development” in there or not, their objectives are completely tied to delivering those policies. Where staff are involved in the estates and procurement side, in complying with greening </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Government targets, again their objectives are clearly tied to that. The voluntary network of Green Guardians has sustainability as a corporate objective within their objectives. As we gather volunteers again, that will be recognised by the Department as a corporate contribution. We do it in a number of ways for people whose business objectives clearly align, but also for those who are contributing in a more corporate way that that contribution is also recognised.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q30 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Martin </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What training on sustainable development is there within the Department?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Emma Ward</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think the training that is available tends to be led out of DEFRA and DECC.

The strategy itself was setting down all the actions we take. There are specific funding initiatives that we have, one called the Revolving Green Fund, which provides funding to universities to make environmental improvements and reduce carbon. That is a repayable grant. We did that with Salix Finance in the beginning </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">but we continued that. The first tranche of that made 2.5% savings in carbon for the sector, and 9% by 2020 was the evaluation of that initiative, so we have two more tranches of that. We have just carried out a green fund initiative, funding through the NUS student unions to carry out environmental improvements, both within their universities but within their communities as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Every university has to have a carbon management plan in order to get any money from us. Our capital funding is dependent not just on plans but also improving performance, and if they cannot demonstrate that we do not give them a proportion of the capital funding. If they continue not to demonstrate that they will not get any of it. The specific capital programmes that we have all have carbon requirements within them, and environmental requirements and environmental standards specific on the individual programme.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">For all our policy areas everybody has to incorporate sustainable development as part of policy development. Where we have the Higher Education Academy that develops teaching methods for institutions, they have sustainability embedded within the contract that we make with them and they have a sustainability line within their activity. The Leadership Foundation, which teaches aspiring vice chancellors, has sustainable development within its programmes because we say that, “It has to be in your programme”. Our research evaluation framework—which assesses the quality of research every five years, and is the instrument we use to base our funding—has environmental concerns embedded within the impact element of that. I could go on, but I think you have the sense of what it is about.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think staff at HEFCE do not need any encouragement to do this. They are pro-environmental people. We try to build on that by saying, “We need to live the life that we expect others to do”—live what we preach. We have talks coming from people outside. Those higher education institutions do great things. We have them come to talk to us. Very recently, we had students from the University of the West of England come and assess how well we were doing and give us recommendations for improvement. They did that very cleverly by looking at different teams within HEFCE and creating a competition among them to see who could do better, who could have more sustainable travel to work, who could increase their volunteering and so on. I think things like that create a value set and a culture that drives sustainable development in everything we do, so I have given you a flavour of what we do. I hope that demonstrates that there is substance behind it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q41 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Nokes</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I turn to Emma now?

This is not about BIS laying down a checklist, it is about organisations learning from each other. There are a number of our partner organisations for whom this is front and central. You have just heard all the things that HEFCE are doing, and the same goes for the Met Office. They have sustainability front and centre to both their values and the core of what they are about. There are clearly lessons that can be learned from that, and I hope that having formed the Sustainability Committee it will give us a forum within which we can now do that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q42 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Nokes</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Having heard that their work on their sustainability strategy has been quite significant, why is BIS now requiring the Funding Council to develop a framework </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">for sustainable development?

Our relationship with our partner organisations is different in every case. In some cases we do require that sustainability is one of the levers that we have with those partner organisations, but that depends on our relationship with them. As Steve and Howard said, sustainability is one of the things that is written into the grant letter that we have with HEFCE. That will be the case with other partner organisations but it won’t be the case with all. What we will do is look across and see what the performance is like, whether there are things that BIS can learn from that, but also see where it is working, where it is not and whether we need to do more.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q43 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Nokes</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think there is a case for having a uniform approach to it, though?

You have done rather well on those in the last couple of years. I understand you are about two years ahead of your objectives as well, for example, with regards to paper consumption and some emissions as well. Would you attribute that to a change in working practices, or has it come about as a result of a decrease not only in the use of buildings but also the number of employees that you have within the Department?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Howard Orme</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think it has come from both. There is a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">complementarity</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> between what we have to do overall on—I will call it—the austerity agenda. Basically BIS, as a whole, is looking to halve its running costs over the course of the Parliament and to use less. We are also taking the opportunity to do it in a more sustainable way as well. The type of policies we are putting in place—for example, on travel it would be favouring rail over anything else. I am sure you will ask me a question on that later.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of overall, I do not have a precise estimate and being an accountant I have to be careful on this. For example, if you were to ask me to estimate on the carbon reduction of 23%, how much of that was due to downsizing and how much of it was due to other types of activities, I would say that 10% of the 23% was coming through things that we have done, like moving to better buildings. We talk about replacing a biomass boiler and those types of activities, and the remainder is coming through size and activity reduction. That will continue and deliver for us until the end of the programme. I would put it at that sort of proportion. The things that we are doing are actively and positively on the green agenda and it is a significant proportion of our outcome.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q45 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Offord</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you feel that the targets could have been tougher on you?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Howard Orme</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The target was a cross-Government one and I think it all depends where you start from. Let me pick up on the water reduction, which on one hand looks very good at 44%. That is a very significant movement but it puts us at the moment at 10 cubic metres per person per year.

By </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the way, I cannot guarantee we will be able to do that over the period but we are moving ourselves towards more benchmark-driven targets than the overall headline targets.

They will both create a number of construction jobs in the short-term” and then, “Both projects offer wider environmental benefits with approximately £1 million of benefit from the direct reduction of carbon on both sites”.

As I said, we try and monetise all the costs and benefits. There are lots of subtleties around this.

What I would say about the innovation that we made between rounds 2 and 3 was that we started phoning the applicants during the appraisal period. Where there were things that were not clear in their bid it gave the appraisers, the case officers, the economists who appraise the bids, the opportunity to try and tease that information out.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q52 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I just give a hypothetical example?

Sorry, I will try again. We have the two objectives, one of which is sustainable private sector-led growth and one of which is around place, about where the investments will take place.

There are all sorts of trade-offs that have to be made, such as the delivery time, the type, where it is, what the risks are associated with it. Those risks may involve environmental risks. Ultimately, we try and monetise that as much as we can, describe it where we cannot do that, and provide useful information to allow them to make those trade-offs in a transparent and unbiased way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q57 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will bring Mark in on that but just before I do, can I just ask, the actual programme application form that any would-be applicant fills in, in order to get the regional growth funding, for example, where does that include the environmental consequences of the proposals being put forward?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Wilson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It doesn’t specifically ask for applicants to say what environmental damage they think their proposals will cause.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Why not?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Wilson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: However we do ask them to describe the projects or the proposals in sufficient detail to allow all aspects of the project to be appraised.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q58 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But you are not giving any indicators to the would-be applicant that that is what you are looking for in the application, are you?

That is probably the easiest way of doing it. The project will deliver £1.9 of quantified benefits for every £1 of public support. That is in terms of what we have appraised. The applicant presents research findings on the potential social and environmental benefits of the project, including estimates using </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">TfL’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Pedestrian Environment Review System and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">DfT’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> models of carbon reduction, accident reduction and journey times. These benefits approximate to over £20 million over 10 years. The results cannot be verified at this stage but if added to the employment impacts would increase the benefit cost ratio to four.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That was a project that was supported by Ministers on the basis of this additional information that was provided by the applicant, in terms of social and environmental costs and benefits. In terms of where ministerial decisions come in, they then conditionally allocate funding. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Then we go out and essentially check the truthfulness of the bid and the claims around that, and then the decisions are finalised. Those numbers are checked during the due diligence stage. I hope that gives you an example, some sense of how we try and factor those in. We don’t have the expertise to do absolutely everything but we do try and capture as much as we can.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q65 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lazarowicz</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Finally, when bids were invited for the Regional Growth Fund, how strongly did you highlight environmental benefits as being one of the criteria? How far was it used as a mechanism to actually encourage bids to come forward, which would serve wider environmental and green economy objectives? It wasn’t obvious from what I saw from some of the press, but the press only covers a small part so I wonder if you can comment on that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Wilson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We ran a programme of expression of interest meetings and there were some road shows that were led, primarily by Lord Heseltine, and we fielded technical questions from the floor. We stressed throughout those processes and our normal communications that we would look to capture the full range of costs and benefits of each bid. Ultimately all bidders put their best foot forward with their bids. In the example I just quoted, it was a substantial project but they backed up their bid. It was clear to them that they should back up their bid with additional quantified evidence about what the environmental and other benefits would be. It seemed to be among the community; of course, I am sure we could do better but we certainly received that kind of additional information alongside our bids.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Caroline, you wanted to come in.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q66 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline Lucas:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes. Sorry to keep pursuing the famous form, but just to go back to the Chair’s example of building on a flood plain. If the applicant hadn’t volunteered the information that said houses were on a flood plain at what point would that become clear? Are you confident that that would become clear in your due diligence if no one had said it? There may or may not be something on the form that allows an applicant to raise the environmental benefits from a scheme. But if it has not occurred to the applicant or they just decide not to let you know about building on a flood plain, how is that revealed given all of the pledges that there are about trying to embed sustainability?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Wilson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In the specific case of buildings we will look at the planning consents, so that is part of the process for drawing down. Finalising an award would be the appropriate planning permission to be able to build the building. Primarily though, with the Regional Growth Fund, we are looking at projects that go beyond the construction of buildings. They are looking at supporting companies grow their businesses, so it is a slightly different focus than houses on flood plains.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q67 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will turn next to Caroline </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Nokes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but just before I do, in terms of the environmental </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">disbenefits</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> effectively—which appear not to be taken into the calculation when you do this trade off—is there any ongoing work with the National Audit Office looking at how they may assist in embedding sustainable development, in terms of programme applications of this kind?

First of all, I don’t think it is quite right to say that we don’t quantify the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">disbenefits</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of carbon. To the extent possible on the information that we get and then through the due diligence, I think we do try to quantify as many costs and benefits as we </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">can, in line with the Treasury Green Book practice about only looking up to second-order effects. There was a National Audit report on the Regional Growth Fund that was published last May. Again, it is probably easiest if I just quote the relevant sentence. What they said was that the appraisal process was in line with Treasury Green Book practice and, effectively, they had not found any structural weakness in the way that we did the appraisals. If they had seen any sort of structural weakness they would have put it in their report because that is their job.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q68 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Zac</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> Goldsmith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The Natural Capital Committee issued its first report in April this year.

There was a substantial shift in that the individuals who benefit from that will contribute rather more, but only in relation to the benefit that they accrue from that, in measurable terms of their earnings. It is still subsidised provision. We do not expect to get back the full value of the loans that we provide to students. They are discounted at the time we make them technically by the RAB charge, which is the way in which the Treasury advanced them. They are still subsidised broadly by a third. In a sense, at the time of making the loan, we incur a charge on our books then, so the loss is already accounted for at the time of making the loan. It is not passed on to future generations. It is accounted for at the time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q73 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Nokes</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What I was specifically going to move onto next is how much account was taken of the impact of student debt, when those graduates became employed and were seeking mortgages and other forms of lending and was the sustainability of that considered?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Williams</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, it was. There were conversations with the Council of Mortgage Lenders who account for about 95% of lending for residential mortgages. Their view, which I think they have put on record, is that the fact of having a student loan does not affect the student’s credit-worthiness, per se, so their ability to get a mortgage is not determined by whether or not they have a student loan. Of course, the student loan potentially requires them to outlay more per month if they are earning above the relevant threshold. That would be taken into account by the mortgage company in assessing the affordability of any mortgage that they would get, just in the way that they want to know about your utility bills and your travel bills and all those kind of things.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We do not share data with mortgage companies.

We plan to look at it again in 2015. Even then, it may well be a little difficult to assess the impact of the new system because no one who has taken out a loan in the new system is due to repay under the new system until April 2016, so in terms of real new data that will be rather limited. But we will still take a look at it on the basis of what we can at the time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q76 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Nokes</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Have you done any research on the psychological impact on gradates of the levels of debt that they are accruing during their time at university and the length of time it will take them to pay them off?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Williams</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We haven’t. In the short term, the main issue we were concerned about was, was there going to be an impact of the new system on participation in higher education, particularly of students from backgrounds who have a lower tendency to attend higher education? A lot of work was done in assessing that. If you ask students who come from lower income backgrounds they will be much more likely to say they are debt averse than those from higher income backgrounds. But in practice, we found that the number of applications from students from low income backgrounds has been increasing more rapidly than those from higher income backgrounds. We are not entirely sure what the relationship is between their expressed preference and how they behave.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Again there is a timing issue. We ask students about how they feel when they are at university. There is a national student survey and all kinds of questions asked from time to time, but I suspect we won’t get any meaningful real data on how it affects their long-term wellbeing until they are out in the labour market. To get any meaningful data it will probably require a longitudinal study, starting perhaps a few years from now.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q77 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Simon Wright:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have a few questions about the industrial strategies of which 11 have been published.

From our point of view of looking for the work where Government intervention can make a difference now, in making sure the benefits were shared across society, we went on the basis that nuclear, oil and gas and offshore wind were much further advanced and, therefore, where the work would need to be done now.

I am sure you will be relieved to know that we don’t intend just to look at BIS. We will be looking at other Departments as well. We look forward to receiving the further evidence that you have referred to in the written form, and I will bring the session to a close.
