At school I was among the last to be picked for any team; as an adult in control of my own participation I became a national champion in my sport. I strongly believe that many of the factors preventing participation in sport are to do with basic skills development, misguided beliefs that people’s sporting ability can be judged at a young age resulting in people opting out of sport too early, and a lack of perseverance around developing fitness, strength and athleticism. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">I believe that the most influential people in a woman’s sporting life are her family, peers and coaches; I do not believe that elite female athletes encourage participation, although they may inspire young athletes who are stepping on to an elite path. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">As well as removing barriers to women’s participation in sport, I suggest we focus on surrounding young women with people showing them what it looks like to set out on a wet morning to run in the cold half-light, demonstrating what it looks like to make a regular commitment to sport, and making such a commitment the norm in a woman’s life, rather than an exception.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">My specific comments on issues that I have seen make a difference in my athletic life, and in others’ lives, follow.

Clubs ultimately lose paying members because they refuse to discipline misbehaving volunteers, leaving athletes facing unpleasant choices about tolerating unpleasant behaviour or leaving the sport all together. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">This could be remedied by creating and enforcing codes of conduct for coaches, whether voluntary or paid, and increasing access to nationally certified coaching qualifications that include general coaching as well as sports specific skills. Peak national organisations could offer a confidential reporting service that gives athletes an avenue for seeking advice about problem coaching in their club, and would help to hold clubs to account for the actions of their coaches. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Access to coaching can make a big difference to adult</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> women taking up or returning to sports. Clubs often focus resources on junior athletes, neglecting their older, motivated membership, which is perplexing given that older members are often in a much better position to contribute to the club financially, to offer useful skills, and to help maintain the club’s human and financial capital. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Clubs, coaches and athletes would all benefit if every member had access to good coaching, rather than treating all younger athletes as potential future professionals and older athletes as too old to be worth spending time on.  </span></p><h1 style="margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 21.6pt; page-break-after:avoid; page-break-inside:avoid; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.6pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">4</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Facilities </span></h1><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">In general sports participation does not require expensive or complex facilities, however, facilities can send a strong message about expectations. For example, clubs that were founded as all male clubs and converted a store room into a female change room in the 1970s, buy new equipment for the men’s team and hand down old kit to the women’s team, and have ‘Pimps and Prostitutes’ themed social events, are probably not encouraging women’s participation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Women’s participation can be invited and supported by investing equally in facilities, equipment and coaching support for both genders, without ignoring the special needs of each. For example, if women come to a sport with a lower base level of strength and fitness, then they may need more access to a weights gym, or more attention from a strength and conditioning coach, than the men do. Aiming for equality across a club shouldn’t come at the expense of attention to gender-specific needs. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">On the topic of clubs, the close association of sports and alcohol is a problem for sports, as it is for society in general. Perhaps sports could lead the way in demonstrating responsible consumption of alcohol, or perhaps it is the other way around. I do not propose a close examination of this topic here, as I believe that sports alone cannot achieve this change. However, I do believe that regular consumption of alchohol in general, and binge drinking in particular, contribute to an unhealthy and unsafe environment for women in sports clubs and at sporting events. </span></p><h1 style="margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 21.6pt; page-break-after:avoid; page-break-inside:avoid; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.6pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">5</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Professionalism (elite sport) v participation</span></h1><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The idea that hosting the Olympics will somehow increase sports participation is a curious one. The Olympics may increase interest in watching sports, but it’s not clear by which mechanism this might lead to more participation. Particularly when elite athletes are presented as ‘stars’ and ‘superhuman’, women are probably not going to identify with female Olympians or be encouraged by their example to take up sport. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">To illustrate the elite v participation dichotomy, perhaps it is helpful to ask how many people cook Nigella Lawson or Jamie Oliver’s recipes in their home, and how many cook from books by Heston Blumenthal. Watching masters of their art at work is engaging and interesting, but it does not encourage people to try it for themselves – and it’s not designed to either. Conversely, individuals who demonstrate how to make something simple, accessible and capable of fitting into a daily </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">routine,</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> are those that encourage others to do it too – both in sports and in cooking. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Similarly, consider how many football fans watching multiple games a week, are actually playing football themselves on a regular basis. This is not to say that elite sports do not merit attention, but only to point out that promoting and facilitating elite sport has little if any impact on participation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Presenting elite athletes as role models may make it appear that the only people who can identify as athletic or sporting are full time athletes.

Without sales data it is impossible to say whether this is due to low demand, or to a perception issue. Either way, it certainly sends a strong signal about women’s demand for sports clothing, and makes me wonder where women trying to play sports buy their clothes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Secondly, while men’s clothing is usually cut to emphasise their strength, women’s clothing appears to be cut to emphasise their breasts. In summer I like to train in a UPF protective long sleeve shirt; one such shirt I purchased had a scoop neckline, which is a bewildering design choice in an item that is meant to protect skin from the sun. There are also singlets that reveal cleavage, requiring care in the choice of accompanying bra, cap sleeve t shirts – compared to the men’s options which reach almost to the elbow, stalls at sporting events that sell t shirts for men but only sleeveless shirts for women, and so on. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">While this may reflect consumer demand, I believe it also reveals a bias about how people think about women’s motivations for playing sport. Sport is so often presented to women as something to do in order to look good, whereas for men there is more attention to its social and physical aspects, and this message is broadcast strongly in the clothing offered for sale to female athletes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Finally, a comment about the commercialisation of mass participation sports.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> A symbiosis has emerged between fundraising and running events, which serves neither cause well. </span><a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/2012/06/charitys-foot-soldiers/"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">This article</span></a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> says much of what I would say on this topic, and I would only add that </span><a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">Parkrun</span></a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">, by contrast, is an ideal model of a low overhead, pro-participation, accessible, efficient (ie. takes 30 minutes in the morning) and highly enjoyable community sports event. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">In conclusion, I propose that to increase participation of women in sports, policy should focus on teaching basic skills as a foundation for sports participation; exposing women to individual sports; offering education and resources for menstrual and breast health; shifting spending to coaching development rather than facilities; and fostering an environment where women regularly see other women participating in sports, by celebrating accessible role models. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">I thank you for the opportunity to present this submission to the Inquiry.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
