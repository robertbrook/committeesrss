We have therefore participated in as many of the 6 pilot projects, which are still running, as possible in order to learn more about how such a system would operate. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 15.5pt; padding-left:2.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">In principle we feel that an offsetting system would be a positive addition to / option for the regulatory development regime in England – combining the improved ability to deliver much needed development with suitably managed and funded enhancements to the country’s natural assets. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 15.5pt; padding-left:2.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">However, we also believe that the current consultation may be premature given that the 6 pilot projects set up to test how such a system could be incorporated are yet to complete their term. I understand that the apparent lack of interest from providers and developers alike in the pilots to date has led to the conclusion that a voluntary system would not work and there is therefore little point in waiting another 6 months for the pilot projects to conclude before confirming that this is the case. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 15.5pt; padding-left:2.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">I feel that this undermines the valuable work that has been undertaken in the pilot areas to date. Furthermore, it does not take into account that for offsetting to be a viable option the developments associated with it are likely to be of a larger scale and therefore making judgements based on an 18 month period when the number of applications of a suitable size that have been submitted has been limited does not seem reasonable. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 15.5pt; padding-left:2.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">The mineral products industry and, Lafarge Tarmac in particular, has a proven legacy of high quality restoration and has further significant potential to protect and enhance biodiversity, including common as well as rare and threatened species and habitats. For example, a RSPB study concluded that our industry could deliver 100% of the UK </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">Biodiversity Action Plan habitat creation targets for 9 out of the 11 priority habitat types identified. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 15.5pt; padding-left:2.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">It is therefore already common practice within the industry for our mineral development projects to seek to offset any biodiversity impacts within the scope of the same scheme, and often a net biodiversity gain is delivered as a result of being able to take a strategic approach to the restoration and landscape creation elements of such a project. However, there can be gaps between the impact of the project commencing and the offset being provided as part of the restoration works. These gaps are invariably minimised and may typically extend to one or two years for a typical sand and gravel operation. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 15.5pt; padding-left:2.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">It is therefore our view that requiring such developments to formally engage with a mandatory offsetting scheme to offset such temporary impacts could potentially stifle future development projects and certainly add to the existing regulatory burden that the industry faces. Given that a steady and adequate supply of aggregate minerals is a prerequisite for the delivery of society’s current and future needs for the built environment then such risks to the industry should therefore be given due consideration. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">Another reason why the pilot projects may not have generated as much interest as initially thought may be due to the implications of the commitment needed to be made by offset providers in order to obtain the associated payments. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">I understand that the long term delivery and maintenance of a habitat that has been offset is critical to the premise of allowing an offset to be made in the first instance. However, asking landowners to commit to undertaking / being responsible for a management regime in perpetuity, when it is nearly impossible to calculate accurately what the costs will be of that regime in 10 years let alone 50, 80 or 99, is likely to cause them some concern and hesitancy towards the prospects being offered. Furthermore, such a commitment being made as a charge against the provider’s property could also affect the future value of that property thus adding another concern / reason for landowners not to progress as offset providers. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">It is my belief that the above mentioned concerns will remain relevant regardless of the size of land required to be set aside for an offset agreement. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">The only type of landowners that are likely to be less concerned about the impact of future management costs and reduced reversionary values are those institutional bodies </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:14pt">that have nature conservation as part of their core objective such as the Forestry Commission, RSPB, National Trust and local Wildlife Trusts.
