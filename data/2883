CQC (under its original remit) and its predecessor body, CSCI, both had responsibility for assessing the quality of local authority commissioning of adult social care services. Since CQC was relieved of the responsibility for monitoring local authority commissioning, there has been no oversight of this area of council activity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.8pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 21.3pt; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">4.2 We had hoped that the Care Bill would allow CQC, to review and assess the performance of the provision and commissioning of adult social services by English local authorities on a routine basis.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Instead at </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Bill report stage (9</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> October 2013) it became clear that any hope of CQC carrying out routine monitoring of LA commissioning is dead in the water.

We are therefore proposing an amendment that will make it clear that the CQC may, with approval from both Secretaries of State of DH and DCLG, undertake a special review of local authority commissioning of adult social services in cases of systematic failure. Subsequent to any such review, CQC could issue an improvement notice in the event of a non-substantial failing and recommend special measures to the Secretary of State in the event of substantial failings. We also intend to issue statutory guidance specifically on local authority commissioning. This will be a valuable opportunity to influence local practice.

This is not just about issues of zero-hours contracts and 15 minute visits.
