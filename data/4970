W</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">hereas the actual number of Arabs who could still claim to be refugees as a result of the Arab-Israeli war of 1947-1949 is today no more than several tens of thousands, the number of those registered as refugees is reaching 5 million, with millions more cl</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">aiming to have that status.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 14pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> (2) Since the Second World War the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has been responsible for the welfare of all refugees in the world and has assisted in their resettlement and relocation – so that nearly all of them are no lo</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">nger refugees – with one exception: the Arabs from Palestine. By contrast, UNRWA, the organisation created specifically to handle the Arab refugees from Palestine from the 1947-1949 Arab-Israel war, has collaborated with the Arab refusal to resettle the re</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">fugees in the areas where they reside, or to relocate them to third countries. Worse, UNRWA has ensured that the refugee issue only grows larger by automatically registering descendants of the original refugees from the war as refugees themselves in perpet</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">uity.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> This practice is entirely not necessitated by UNRWA’s original UN General Assembly mandate. The decision to automatically grant refugee status in perpetuity, while also avoiding any resettlement efforts – without parallel in any other conflict, is en</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">tirely UNRWA’s own. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 14pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">(3) For several decades UNRWA has been engaging in an act of bureaucratic self-aggrandisement, inflating the numbers of those in its care, ensuring the growth of its budget. If the descendants of the Arab refugees from the Arab-Israeli war were treated lik</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">e all other refugees, including the Jewish ones, they would not quality for refugee status because almost all of them (upward of 80 per cent) are either citizens of a third country, such as Jordan, or they live in the places where they were born and expect</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> to have a future such as Gaza and the West Bank. The Palestinians born in the West Bank and Gaza are not fleeing war and are not seeking refuge. They are considered citizens of Palestine by the Palestinian Authority itself, just like all other Palestinian</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">s born in these territories. No other people in the world are registered as refugees while being citizens of another country or territory. Moreover, if the European Union has adopted the policy that Gaza and the West Bank are territories to be allocated to</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Palestine – and some EU countries already recognise Palestine as a state – then </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">it makes no sense for it to argue that people who were born and are living in Palestine are refugees from… Palestine.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 14pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">(4) The remaining 20 per cent of the descendants who are </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">not Jordanian citizens or citizens of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and the West Bank, are inhabitants of Syria and Lebanon who are by law denied the right to citizenship granted to all other Syrians and Lebanese.
