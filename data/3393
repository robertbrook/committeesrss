font-size:12pt">Clause 51 is a remarkable example of a Henry VIII clause and appears to have been constructed with little or no regard to past practice or the recommendations of the House of Lords Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and Constitution Committee.  It is exceptionally wide in terms of scope, while adopting a form of parliamentary scrutiny that is distinct and less rigorous than that utilised for other measures subject to enhanced scrutiny processes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The clause empowers a minister to bring forward an order to provide that a legislative provision that the minister considers is of no practical use shall no longer apply.  There are two fundamental objections.  The first is that there is no objective test embodied in the clause.  The second is that there is no restriction on what may be covered by such an order.  </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The fact that subsequent clauses provide means for Parliament to prevent an order being given effect has no bearing on the objection to scope.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Explanatory Notes (para. 212) state that the Government intends the provision to be used for legislation which can be shown to be no longer of practical use for objective reasons.  It includes an indicative list of such reasons.  Schedule 16 is offered as illustrative of the type of provisions that it is anticipated will be covered by such orders.  The problem with this is that Government intentions have no legislative force: they may be superseded by other intentions; indeed, there is nothing to stop the current Government revisiting and indeed ignoring its stated intentions.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The clause fails the principal test set by the Constitution Committee.  There is nothing in the Explanatory Notes or the memorandum prepared by the Cabinet Office that justifies the breadth of the clause as drafted, that is, with no restrictions on the face of the Bill.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> Clause 54 imposes a duty of consultation, but consultation itself has only one trigger and that is in the gift of the minister.  If the minister does consult, it is then at his discretion whether to make changes and, if he does so, there is a further duty to consult, but again triggered by the minister.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Explanatory Notes refer to the motivation for including reference to the Law Commissions.  They are mentioned ‘specifically mainly because of their existing role in relation to the review and repeal of legislation which is no longer of practical use.  </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">The new power provides an alternative mechanism for the repeal of such legislation’ </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">(paragraph 219; my emphasis).  The reasons for this alternative method are given in the Cabinet Office memorandum (para. 325), although it is noteworthy that they are proffered as ‘advantages’, though without stating who would gain the advantage.  Furthermore, the memorandum asserts that the reasons ‘might’ include the following, a claim implying a degree of uncertainty:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

padding-left:3.8pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Departments will have scope to focus on areas of law which are not being considered by the Law Commission.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 34.32pt; padding-left:4.98pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">The new order making power is likely to be used to disapply subordinate, as well as primary, legislation.  In practice, the Law Commissions </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">[sic] </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Repeals Bills are confined to primary legislation.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The third reason appears to make little sense in that ministers can use existing order making powers to deal with delegated legislation.  The other two generate cause for concern, in that Departments are not necessarily well qualified to undertake the scrutiny that is equivalent to that provided by the Law Commission.  Furthermore, the reasons, combined with the provisions of the Draft Bill, do nothing to dispel the fear that the clause represents a means of allowing Departments to engage in what is essentially a short-cut procedure for removing unwanted legislation.  In bringing forward orders under the clause, there is no obligation on a minister to consult the Law Commission, unless he thinks it appropriate, nor any requirement to have regard to the advice offered by the Commission.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Cabinet Office memorandum (para. 325) seeks to justify the process (essentially in relation to point (a) above) by noting that the Law Commission fulfils its responsibility ‘through the Statute Law (Repeals) Bills which are introduced every there [sic] or four years’.  The implied concern here is with the time taken to produce such measures.  However, the reference is important in that it reminds us that the fruits of the Law Commission’s work are Bills.  Normally, such Bills are not contentious, but they are nonetheless Bills, subject to the normal parliamentary stages.</span><a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">  It is not the practice to move amendments, but ‘there is’, as Erskine May records, ‘no formal restriction on the amendments which may be moved’.</span><a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">   It is thus open to each House to amend such Bills, for example, by removing one of the measures earmarked for repeal.  Under Clause 51 of the Draft Bill, a minister could group several measures deemed to be of no practical use in one order and each House would have the option only of agreeing or rejecting the order.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The value of utilising the Law Commission is apparent from the Commission’s own report on its work:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 28pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">But even if a Department could spend time reviewing its obsolete laws, that would have no impact on the legislation affecting other Departments. Given that the statute book spreads across the policy issues of every Department, there is a clear advantage in having an agency that is at arm’s length from individual Departments, whilst being in a position to review the statute book as a whole. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 28pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The advantage of statute law repeals work being carried out by the Commission is therefore three-fold. To start with, resources to carry out the work are ring-fenced from other activities. Secondly, the Commission is able to review the whole of the statute book and not just part of it. Thirdly, this specialist work is carried out by a small body of lawyers with the expertise accumulated and passed on over nearly half a century. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">There is also a fourth advantage. The Commission is independent in the exercise of its statutory functions and therefore has no axe to grind in recommending reform. This is equally true of the Commission’s statute law repeals work. When Parliament considers the Commission’s repeals Bills it does so knowing not only that the work </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">has been thoroughly researched and is therefore legally sound, but also that the Bill’s contents are not influenced in any way by the vagaries of political consideration or expediency.</span><a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">To create an alternative to this process, drawing on resources they may not be as qualified – the Law Commission has its own dedicated Statute Law Repeals team – and as detached as the Commission necessitates a strong, not to say a compelling, case.  The reasons advanced in the Cabinet Office memorandum are not persuasive and fail to engage with two alternatives.  One is to make consultation with the Law Commission a requirement for all draft orders, removing the minister’s discretion.  That would necessitate a minor amendment to the Bill.  The other is an alternative to Clause 51 and that is for ministers who believe legislation is no longer of practical use to refer the matter to the Law Commission to consider independently of its own normal review.  The legislation could then either be incorporated in the Commission’s regular review or be the product of a separate and more immediate report.  The Commission has in the past been asked by Government to report on particular matters referred to it (as with post-legislative scrutiny, on which it reported in 2006) and a more regular process of referral could be incorporated in the protocol on the Commission’s work, agreed from time to time by the Commission and the Lord Chancellor.</span><a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">  Any concern with this proposal would not therefore be one of remit, but of resources should referrals be numerous.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The provision for parliamentary approval (clauses 55-56) adds a new procedure to the growing diversity, and complexity, of processes for parliamentary deliberation and approval.  The proposal for the use of such a procedure is open two objections.  First, it fails to engage with other procedures for scrutiny of Henry VIII provisions.  The Cabinet Office memorandum (para. 328) states that it is based on section 16 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, but makes no reference to the other methods, embodied in other Acts of Parliament, used for parliamentary scrutiny of provisions that enable ministers to amend primary legislation.  Furthermore, the use made of the 2006 Act is partial.  Section 15 of the 2006 Act provides different options, with the minister having to justify whichever he selects, and section 18 provides that in the event of the use of the super-affirmative procedure, the minister must have regard to any recommendations made by a committee of either House of Parliament charged with reporting on the draft order.  No such obligation is included in the draft Bill.   Second, and related, the mechanism is a relatively weak one.  It is enhanced in relation to the usual negative resolution procedure, but it is not on a par with the enhanced affirmative procedure embodied in the Public Bodies Act 2011 or indeed section 18 of the 2006 Act.  Furthermore, orders under the 2006 Act are more constrained in terms of purpose than applies in the case of Clause 51.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">There is a third objection, one to which I attach particular importance.  The discussion and justification for the provision in the Explanatory Notes and Cabinet Office memorandum are advanced without any reference to reports of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on Henry VIII provisions.  The Committee, in its special report in December 2002, concluded, in respect of the twelve cases of Henry VIII provisions that it examined:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We note… that, as with their wording, the level of Parliamentary scrutiny varies. In some cases the negative procedure is used; in some the affirmative; and in others the affirmative procedure is used if an enactment is to be amended but otherwise negative.  We are not surprised that this is the case.  </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">We recognise that in some instances the negative procedure provides a sufficient level of Parliamentary scrutiny.  We take the view, however, that there should be a presumption in favour of the affirmative procedure and that reasons for any departure from the affirmative procedure should be set out in full in the Explanatory Notes accompanying a bill and in the memorandum submitted to this Committee.</span><a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In its more recent report on the subject, it concluded that the existence of so many variations of such scrutiny procedures is not helpful ‘either to Parliament or to the public in understanding the scrutiny process’.</span><a name="_ftnref11"></a><a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">  It continued:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The House may wish to consider whether it might be more appropriate to take the bolder course of rationalising the entire range of current variations by legislation.  In the meantime, we make the following recommendations designed to prevent unnecessary proliferation in the number of future variations.  </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">We recommend that in proposing a strengthened scrutiny procedure in any future Bill the Government should normally use an existing model rather than creating a new variation; and they should explain the basis for the decision.  If the Government exceptionally take the view that it is necessary to create yet another variation rather than using an existing statutory scrutiny procedure, the reasons should be set out clearly in the Explanatory Notes to the Bill and in the delegated powers memorandum.</span><a name="_ftnref12"></a><a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Explanatory Notes recite the provisions of Clauses 55 and 56, but make no case, full or otherwise, for the scrutiny procedure proposed.  The Cabinet Office memorandum merely refers to the procedure being 'considered to provide adequate safeguards and an appropriate level of scrutiny for these orders’.  The only justification offered, in so far as it can be styled as such, is that it is based on section 16 of the 2006 Act.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Clause 51 is sweeping in scope – it is not confined </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">to specified and limited purposes of the</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> sort that may justify the negative resolution procedure – and essentially fails to meet the criteria advanced by the House of Lords Constitution Committee.  Ministers may reach the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">conclusion that a major Act of Parliament is, in their view, of no practical use.  In so far as ministers may bring forward orders covering legislation, they may group several legislative provisions.  There is thus a </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">prima facie</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> case for enhanced parliamentary scrutiny, one that – following the recommendations of the Delegated Powers Committee – draws on an existing procedure and is subject to the affirmative procedure, unless a clear case is made to the contrary.  No such case is to be found in the Explanatory Notes or in the Cabinet Office memorandum.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In summary, this part of the Draft Bill proposing Henry VIII powers is deficient not only on the face of its provisions, but also in the way that it has been brought before Parliament.  It is not clear whether the provision has been advanced in ignorance, or defiance, of the recommendations of the Delegated Powers Committee.  Whichever, it constitutes a serious failing.    </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Finally, I revert to the point already made in respect of parliamentary scrutiny, that is, that there appears nothing to prevent a minister bringing forward a draft order to repeal several Acts or provisions of Acts.  Parliament would thus be left with the task of utilising, within a short period of time, a blunt weapon to prevent its enactment.  Parliament would not be able to exercise its regular function of scrutiny.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">There is also a potential problem in that a Government secure in its majority in the House of Commons may seek to use that majority to approve a draft order that repeals an Act of Parliament that the Government regards as inconvenient.  This would enable it to by-pass the necessary stages of a repeal Bill.  That would place a particular burden on the diligence and scrutiny processes of the House of Lords.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">CONCLUSION</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In the view of Lord Judge, by allowing Henry VIII Clauses </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11.5pt">‘to become a habit, we are already in great danger of becoming indifferent to them, and to the fact that they are being enacted on our behalf.’</span><a name="_ftnref13"></a><a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11.5pt">  There have been numerous examples of such provisions, but only a limited number where the scope of the power is such as to justify enhanced parliamentary scrutiny.  Clause 51 of this Draft Bill is essentially at the top end of the range.  The manner in which it has been produced and justified (or rather not justified) is reminiscent of what happened in respect of the Public Bodies Bill, when Government took the view that the affirmative resolution procedure would be adequate for orders to reform or abolish major public bodies.  In the light of the objections advanced in the House of Lords, that procedure was abandoned in favour of the super-affirmative procedure that now applies.  The fact that this part of the Draft Deregulation Bill providing for Henry VIII powers has been brought forward in apparent disregard of that experience (not even providing for an affirmative resolution procedure) and of the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, is a matter of deep concern.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11.5pt">Given the foregoing, there are two alternative options.  One is to restrict the scope of Clause 51, putting on the face of the Bill the material contained in the Explanatory Notes, and to provide </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11.5pt">for an enhanced method of parliamentary approval, drawing on an existing super-affirmative procedure.  The other would be to omit Clauses 51-57.  Given the other methods available to achieve the same ends as Clause 51 (referral to the Law Commission, short repeal Bills), and the fact that the Government has failed to make a persuasive case for by-passing these methods, the clauses should in my view be omitted from the Bill. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;
