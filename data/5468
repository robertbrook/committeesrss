font-size:12pt">The result, which we have been observing in the context of advising clients since the draft proposals were made, is that an LLP is now deemed a ‘dangerous’ and an uncertain choice.  We have already seen businesses in the course of set up and which it would have made commercial sense to structure as partnerships, shifting away from LLP structures for no good reason other than the new draft provisions. We doubt this was the intended goal of the provisions.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The position becomes even less satisfactory to our mind when the specific three conditions chosen by HMRC are examined.  In the interest of keeping the commentary brief we do not propose an exhaustive analysis and a large number of examples, but are happy to provide more details if the Sub Committee finds this of use.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We refer first to Condition B – the significant influence condition.  HMRC guidance suggests that 'sufficient influence' would not exist merely because a member has voting rights or the ability to participate in the election of senior management. Instead, according to HMRC, actual participation in the management of the affairs of the LLP is required. The reference to affairs is being interpreted to mean all the affairs - or business as a whole - of the LLP, as opposed to some aspects or some business lines only. On this basis, in the case of many professional partnerships Condition B is unlikely to be satisfied other than in relation to senior management. Even in the context of smaller operations conducted through LLPs the test may exclude most members. For example in a typical asset management business, key members would be responsible for managing one or more investment portfolios, but not the business of the firm as a whole – this will many times be the role of a professional manager or a management committee.  It follows that there may be a </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">small number only of members in any LLP who may satisfy the sufficient influence test.  We observe that typically such members are not be the key executives who are, in the language of the general partnership legislation, carrying on the business of the partnership together with a view to a profit.   Instead, they are more likely to be the persons who were appointed as the managers of the business who are in fact typically the only persons within the firm who are not actually engaged in the carrying on of the business itself.  It is unclear to us why the test is structured to prefer the latter over the former in the context of the employed vs. self-employed debate.  But it appears clear that the majority of members in LLPs will not be able to rely on this test for the purpose of escaping the consequences of becoming salaried members, and therefore being treated as employees for tax purposes.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Moving on, while the definition of contribution for the purposes of Condition C is technical, and complex, it is broadly restricted to capital contributed to the LLP, so does not include retained or undistributed profits which many times fulfil the same purpose as capital, nor is it clear that loan accounts would constitute capital for these purposes. The condition sets a significant capital contribution requirement: broadly it fails in the case of a member whose non-LLP profit related drawings (as to which see further below) exceed 25% of the same member's capital contribution. We note in this context that it is relatively unusual for professional partnerships to require significant capital accounts. Firms operating in the financial services industry and organised as LLPs may have regulatory capital requirements and so capital contribution from members is not uncommon as a business matter, but in such circumstances significant capital would typically be contributed by a small number of partners, and many times these would be the corporate partners backing the business, as opposed to the key working members who embody the business (and who would be considered partners in the general partnership context). We would not therefore expect Condition B alone to come to the rescue of members of LLPs in any realistic scenario.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">This leaves Condition A. Paraphrasing the language already noted above, Condition A requires a member's remuneration in the form of a profit share from the LLP to amount to at least 20% (this is what HMRC consider the term "substantially" to mean) of the member's remuneration. The test is obviously aimed at fixed or guaranteed remuneration deals, which clearly do not relate to the profits of the LLP.  But HMRC's guidance also states that amounts paid by way of bonuses linked to individual member's performance, as well as remuneration generally linked to individual performance (which presumably includes "eat what you kill" arrangements) would not be viewed as entitlements to a share of the profits of the LLP as a whole.  Rather, HMRC believe such amounts relate to a share of the profits (or perhaps income) of that part of the business of the LLP within which the individual member operates, and against which his performance is measured. We do not agree with the way in which HMRC appear to interpret the impact of the proposed legislation in many cases. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Fundamentally so-called bonuses relating to members performance, and "eat what you kill" models are methods for determining the size of a member's share of the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">profits of the LLP - as opposed to a substantive entitlement to a share in part only of the business of the LLP.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="16" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">But leaving this point to one side, it is disturbing that HMRC view performance related profit shares and "eat what you kill" models when implemented in the context of an LLP as abuse of the tax legislation which requires counteraction. The same point can be made in relation to a large number of the examples provided in HMRC's guidance. We broadly agree in this context with that part of HMRC's guidance which notes as a technical matter that as drafted advances made to partners (in anticipation of future profits), and guaranteed payments, may be caught by Condition A. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="17" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">What the proposal seems to ignore is that business reality (and in the case of some firm the business model) anticipates the need for advances, and guaranteed payments, in the start-up years when profits may be slow, as well as when recruiting key members who are fundamental to the business carried on by all the members. It is again a concern that the proposed legislation sees such scenarios as correct hallmarks for the type of abuse which - rightly - should be tackled in the context of persons who do not embody the business of the firm and are at heart employees.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;
