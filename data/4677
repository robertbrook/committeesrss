Many schools, particularly smaller ones in the primary sector, have historically benefitted from cost effective support functions (such as HR and payroll) being pr</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ovided by local authorities. Because these local authorities (county, unitary and metropolitan boroughs) are by their very nature large organisations, such servic</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">es have generally been provided at a relatively low cost due to the economies of scale offered</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> by being administered as part of a large employer</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">’s functions</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">. The true unit cost of such support services has never been particularly evident as it has been a part of a much larger corporate budget. The need to properly fund such services is brought into</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> sharp </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">focus </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">when a school acquires academy status, as generally local authorities are disinclined to make such services available to academy schools; and furthermore councils are increasingly choosing not to provide such services to any schools, given the</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> changed education landscape.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In such circumstances, the starting point is that individual academies (unless part of a well-structured multi-academy chain) are required to provide or procure for such services themselves. As alluded to above, this </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">has the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">potential to increase the unit cost of providing such services, as an individual school (particularly a smaller primary) will not be able to purchase them, unilaterally, at such an attractive rate as they notionally had from the local authority. Such an in</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">creased unit cost has the potential to impact adversely on the remaining funds available for frontline education, thereby </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">possibly </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">negating on</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">e of</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> the supposed benefits of academisation.

At the same time</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">, local authorities have sometimes been prepared to take difficult decisions to close small, inefficient schools or require them to undertake </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">collaboration, amalgamation and / or federation, even where</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> there may have been a reluctance to do so. This landscape has now changed, as any small maintained school which might be under threat from </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">such a significant change or closure from </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">a local authority is generally inclined to opt for academisation to effect</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ively save them from </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">such change or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">closure. We have seen this happen in a number of parts of the country, thereby rendering </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">local </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">pupi</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">l-place planning </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">on this basis </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">irrelevant.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Whilst we understand why this change may have been introduced, it does raise </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">questions as to whether the academisation of schools has the potential to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">exacerbate</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> the poor use of resources in small inefficient schools, to the wider detriment of those more viable schools which are seeking to operate on a more effective basis. There i</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">s also the risk that, given the increasingly tight economic climate and the consequences for school funding, these small inefficient schools may suffer a “slow death” if they opt for academy conversion, as they are unlikely to be able to rise to the challe</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">nge of effectively managing themselves as such a small unit – even if they are notionally supported by an academy sponsor. We therefore believe that the academisation of schools does possibly provide a too generous extended safety net for very small school</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">s, which </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">may be </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">unlikely to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">viably </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">stand on their own two feet as fully-fledged academies. It is hoped that the Education Committee will give consideration as to how the dichotomy of very small schools and their viability should be addressed within an acad</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">emised structure of education. At the moment it has the potential to be an anomaly for which there is no easy way of tackling, other than anticipating the “slow death” of such schools as rolls fall and surplus places rise, which cannot be good for the rema</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ining pupils in the schools.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">So, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">in summary – returning to the overall themes set out in this submission – </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">we recognise the journey which many schools are on: particularly in the direction of academisation. Whilst there are undoubtedly risks for many scho</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ols (especially smaller ones) in acquiring academy status, we equally recognise that there are many potential benefits and opportunities for schools </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">in assuming</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> greater oversight for their own affairs.
