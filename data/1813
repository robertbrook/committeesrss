reorganise in order to deliver value for money and ECC social aspirations. To do this effectively the procurement team was required to change its structure, approach and capability. The primary aim was to get closer to the business and assist them make more informed commercial decisions. As a consequence, the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">team has undergone a major transformation, as it has shifted from being predominantly a transactional buying team to one now viewed as a commercial partner to the business.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">ECC developed the existing internal resources and recruited additional employees with broader commercial experience. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">This was a difficult transition to make, as it required existing employees to undertake a very different role. One of the key tasks was to empower the team to challenge the spending patterns of the business, in a constructive manner, and encourage them to adopt new buying behaviours; ultimately to achieve improved outcomes at a lower total cost.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">ECC has built a procurement team that has: </span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 46.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Adopted Category Management, which allows cross discipline teams to identify outcomes and options to deliver them. </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 46.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Focussed on integrating Procurement with commissioners.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 46.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Introduced Supply Chain Management to drive additional value from the active management of strategic suppliers, including continuous improvement and innovation.</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The introduction of a category management approach has enabled ECC to achieve efficiency savings through a combination of re-tendering / negotiation; demand management and market-shaping initiatives. Additionally, there has been a high degree of relationship development with strategic suppliers that has been enabled by long-term agreements that lend themselves to much more collaborative working. Examples include:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Consolidated all Highways requirements into a single long-term (10+5) contract with one provider, Ringway Jacobs (RJ), in a move away from the traditional supplier/buyer contractual arrangement into a strategic relationship where RJ and ECC staff sit alongside each other to jointly deliver defined outcomes. Savings of £5m have already been achieved and there is potential for this to develop into a joint venture or similar arrangement in the future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Previously, all Property Management &amp; Facilities Management services were contracted individually and ECC had multiple small contracts with many suppliers to manage. The PM/FM approach was to combine both requirements into a single prime contractor long-term (10 + 5) arrangement. The result has been a significant reduction in numbers of internal staff and savings delivered of £3.1m with further savings to be achieved from Supply Chain Management initiatives. In addition a number of other services have now been added to the initial contract. The agreement was set up on a flexible basis i.e. it provided MITIE with a set of core services and there were optional services that could be added depending on performance and demonstration </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">of value for money.

ECC sought a commitment of one – two apprenticeships for each £1m of spend; MITIE the eventual winner, committed to almost doubling this amount.  As part of this drive, ECC has already secured commitment to over 270 new apprenticeship opportunities through a range of contracts.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Some of the suppliers have gone further than just committing to increasing the number of apprenticeships and have worked with the Procurement supply chain manager on promoting social employment schemes and supporting local suppliers.

The factors that determine which tier the supplier is assigned include: annual contract value; total length of contract; criticality of the service provided and how easily this could transfer to another supplier; strategic importance; and impact of failure.

The summary of the findings were as follows:</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Across seven key attributes Category Management was assessed as upper quartile in all seven.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Across the same seven key attributes SCM - two were assessed as upper quartile; five were assessed as comparable to peers.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Effectiveness in both the delivery and quantum of savings achieved compare very favourably with peers.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Supply Chain Management is acknowledged as an emerging discipline and ECC should be applauded for embracing it with the assessor commenting that ECC were further forward than many peers in both public &amp; private sector.</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h4 style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt; page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">In addition, ECC carries out a range of benefits realisation reviews / benchmarking of a number of its key suppliers arrangements, where suppliers are formally and routinely required to provide evidence to demonstrate that their costs are competitive against other players in the market. This approach also applies to the collaborative agreements that are in place. For example, </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">SMARTE East is a procurement framework for construction projects in the public sector, formed as an alliance between </span><a href="http://www.essex.gov.uk/" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">Essex</span></a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">, </span><a href="http://www.hertsdirect.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">Hertfordshire</span></a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal"> and </span><a href="http://www.suffolk.gov.uk/" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">Suffolk County Councils</span></a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">. The framework is split into Lots depending on the requirement and the value of the project. Despite the fact that each procurement is subject to a mini-competition off the framework, a percentage of the requirements are openly competed on the market to actively demonstrate VfM and also to allow local / SME’s to compete for more contracts. </span></h4><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">ECC is very confident that given the total achievements of its Procurement team that it can provide central government with the necessary assurances that value for money (in the broadest sense) is routinely delivered. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
