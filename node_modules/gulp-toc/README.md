## Usage

Generate a Table of Contents

```javascript
var toc = require('gulp-toc');

gulp.task('toc', function() {
  gulp.src('./*.html')
    .pipe(toc())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'))
});
```

## Options

All options supported by [node-toc](https://github.com/cowboy/node-toc) are supported.

## Header

By default, node-toc uses `<!-- toc -->` as the placeholder for the generated table of contents.

You can use `gulp-header` to insert the placeholder into all your files.

```javascript
var toc = require('gulp-toc');
var header = require('gulp-header');

gulp.task('toc', function() {
  gulp.src('./*.html')
    .pipe(header('<!-- toc -->\n'))
    .pipe(toc())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'))
});
```
